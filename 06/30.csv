nucleosynthesis from neutrino-heated supernova ejecta remains a sensitive probe

extends to a wider class of spacetimes previous results of Geroch and Tipler
that show that topology change is only to be had at a price. The scenarios
studied here are ones in which an initial spacelike surface is joined by a
connected ``interpolating spacetime'' to a final spacelike surface, possibly of
different topology. The interpolating spacetime is required to obey a condition
called causal compactness, a condition satisfied in a very wide range of
situations. No assumption is made about the dimension of spacetime. First, it
is stressed that topology change is kinematically possible; i.e., if a field
equation is not imposed, it is possible to construct topology-changing
spacetimes with non-singular Lorentz metrics. Simple 2-dimensional examples of
this are shown. Next, it is shown that there are problems in such spacetimes:
Geroch's closed-universe argument is applied to causally compact spacetimes to
show that even in this wider class of spacetimes there are causality violations
associated with topology change. It follows from this result that there will be
causality violations if the initial (or the final) surface is not connected,
even when there is no topology change. Further, it is shown that in dimensions
$\geq 3$ causally compact topology-changing spacetimes cannot satisfy
Einstein's equation (with a reasonable source); i.e., there are severe
dynamical obstructions to topology change. This result extends a previous one
due to Tipler. Like Tipler's result, it makes no assumptions about geodesic
completeness; i.e., it does not permit topology change even at the price of
singularities (of the standard incomplete-geodesic variety). Brief discussions
are also given of ways in which the results of this paper might be
circumvented.

the coupling with the environment is via the position coordinate.

calculation of finite-temperature decay rates for a metastable state of a
quantum field theory. To do this, we consider the Gross-Neveu model with an
explicit chiral symmetry breaking term, which allows for a metastable state.
This theory can be shown to have a ""critical bubble"" which is a solution to the
*exact* equations of motions (i.e. to all orders in perturbation theory,
including all higher derivative, quantum and thermal corrections). This
configuration mediates the thermal activation of the metastable vacuum to the
true ground state, with a decay rate $\Gamma \propto \exp(-F_c/T)$, where $F_c$
is the free energy of the critical bubble. We then compare this exact
calculation to various approximations that have been used in previous work. We
find that these approximations all *overestimate* the activation rate.
Furthermore, we study the effect of finite baryon number upon the bubble
profile and the activation barriers. We find that beyond a critical baryon
number the activation barriers disappear altogether.

differential calculus on an associative algebra. This is an analogue of the
calculus of differential forms on a manifold. In this short review we collect
examples of differential calculi on commutative algebras (which can be regarded
as algebras of functions on some topological space). We explain how these are
related to relevant structures in physics.

temperature which is proportional to the acceleration. Also, in string theory
there is a Hagedorn temperature beyond which one cannot go without an infinite
amount of energy. Several authors have shown that in the context of Hawking
radiation a limiting temperature for string theory leads to a limiting
acceleration, which for a black hole implies a minimum distance from the
horizon for an observer to remain stationary. We argue that this effectively
introduces a cutoff in Rindler space or the Schwarzschild geometry inside of
which accelerations would exceed this maximum value. Furthermore, this natural
cutoff in turn allows one to define a finite entropy for Rindler space or a
black hole as all divergences were occurring on the horizon. In all cases if a
particular relationship exists between Newton's constant and the string tension
then the entropy of the string modes agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking
formula.

sl(2,R)+sl(2,R) / sl(2,R), and argue that they are finitely nonfreely
generated. Furthermore, we discuss in detail their role as unifying W-algebras
of Casimir W-algebras. We show that it is possible to give coset realizations
of various types of unifying W-algebras, e.g. the diagonal cosets based on the
symplectic Lie algebras sp(2n) realize the unifying W-algebras which have
previously been introduced as `WD_{-n}'. In addition, minimal models of WD_{-n}
are studied. The coset realizations provide a generalization of
level-rank-duality of dual coset pairs. As further examples of finitely
nonfreely generated quantum W-algebras we discuss orbifolding of W-algebras
which on the quantum level has different properties than in the classical case.
We demonstrate in some examples that the classical limit according to Bowcock
and Watts of these nonfreely finitely generated quantum W-algebras probably
yields infinitely nonfreely generated classical W-algebras.

"hep-th/9406204","Jean-Bruno Erismann","A. Jadczyk","Topics in Quantum Dynamics","31 pages, latex, 2 fig",,,"CPT-94/P.3022","hep-th",,"  The paper consists of two parts. In the first part Schroedinger's equation
for a charged quantum particle in a Galilei-Newton curved space-time is derived
in a fully geometrical way. Gravitational and electromagnetic fields are coded
into space metric and space-time connection. The fundamental geometrical object
is a quantum connection in a Hermitian line bundle over the 7-dimensional jet
space of 3-velocities. The secondary object is the bundle of Hilbert spaces
over absolute time. Time appears as a superselection quantity while Shroedinger
equation is interpreted as parallel transport in this bundle. In the second
part the problem of measurement in quantum theory is discussed as a part of a
more general problem of coupling between quantum and classical systems. The
standard framework of quantum theory is extended so as to allow for dynamical
central observables within dissipative dynamics. It is shown that within this
approach one obtains not only Liouville equation that describes statistical
ensembles, but also a piecewise-deterministic random process describing
sequences of ""events"" that can be monitored by a continuous observation of the
single, coupled classical system. It also describes ""quantum jumps"" or ""wave
packet reductions"" that accompany these events. Two example are worked out in
some details. The last one deals with the problem oof ""how to determine the
wave function ?"".

Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain models and propose the continuum
version of them. Results of boundary conformal field theory are useful in
making a connection between the discrete and continuum pictures. The $W$
constraints are derived from the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. We also
check that these equations are consistent with other known results about
noncritical string theory. The string field Hamiltonian is easily obtained from
the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. It looks similar to Kaku-Kikkawa's
Hamiltonian and may readily be generalized to $c>1$ cases.

in four dimensional field theory. By using a large Higgs mass expansion, we
then evaluate the effective action of the closed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen
vortex string. It is shown that the effective action contains the Nambu-Goto
term and an extrinsic curvature squared term with negative sign. We next
evaluate the topological $\FtF$ term and find that it becomes the sum of an
ordinary self-intersection number and Polyakov's self-intersection number of
the world sheet swept by the vortex string. These self-intersection numbers are
related to the self-linking number and the total twist number, respectively.
Furthermore, the $\FtF$ term turns out to be the difference between the sum of
the writhing numbers and the linking numbers of the vortex strings at the
initial time and the one at the final time. When the vortex string is coupled
to fermions, the chiral fermion number of the vortex string becomes the
writhing number (modulo $\bZ$) through the chiral anomaly. Our formulation is
also applied to ``global'' vortex strings in a model with a broken global
$U(1)$ symmetry.

can be treated as a generalization of bound states embedded in continuum on the
case of discrete spectrum states. Formation of IS in the spectrum of quantum
system is studied using a simple rank--2 separable potential with harmonic
oscillator formfactors. Some physical applications are discussed, in
particular, we propose separable $NN$ potential that describes not only most
important two-nucleon data (deuteron binding energy and s-wave triplet and
singlet scattering phases) but also the trinucleon binding energy without
making use of three-body forces.
