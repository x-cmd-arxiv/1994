Abstract: To a trajectory of a billiard in parallelogram we assign its symbolic
trajectory - the sequence of numbers of coordinate plane, to which the faces
met by the trajectory are parallel. The complexity of the trajectory is the
number of different words of length $n$ occurring in it. We prove that for

confirming the conjecture of Arnoux, Mauduit, Shiokawa and Tamura [AMST].

particle moving on a tight-binding square lattice in the presence of a gauge
field, when coupling to next nearest sites is added. We find, from numerical
and analytical studies, that the scaling behavior of the total width of the
spectrum and the multifractal nature of the spectrum are unchanged, provided
the next nearest neighbor coupling terms are below a certain threshold value.
The full square symmetry of the Hamiltonian is not required for criticality,
but the square diagonals should remain as reflection lines. A bicritical line
is found at the boundary between the region in which the nearest neighbor terms
dominate and the region in which the next nearest neighbor terms dominate. On
the bicritical line a different critical exponent for the width of the spectrum
and different multifractal behavior are found. In the region in which the next
nearest neighbor terms dominate the behavior is still critical if the
Hamiltonian is invariant under reflection in the directions parallel to the
sides of the square, but a new length scale enters, and the behavior is no
longer universal but shows strongly oscillatory behavior. For a flux per unit
cell equal to $1/q$ the measure of the spectrum is proportional to $1/q$ in
this region, but if it is a ratio of Fibonacci numbers the measure decreases
with a rather higher inverse power of the denominator.

expected, soft-gluon effects become stronger when the decay particles are less

expansion in QCD using the light-cone quantization. These are second-quantized
hamiltonians acting on the Fock space of mesons and glueballs defined by the
solution of the $N=\infty$ problem. In the two-dimensional case we find only
cubic and quartic interaction terms, and give explicit expressions for the
vertex functions as integrals of solutions of 't Hooft equation. As examples of
possible applications of our formalism, we study 1/N corrections to meson mass
and form factors for decays of $Q\bar{q}$ states, recently discussed by
Grinstein and Mende in the large-N limit. We find that 1/N is a good small
expansion parameter.

to describing $2d$ string theory at the self-dual radius. We define the model
by analytical continuation of $q>1$ topological recursion relations to $q=-1$.
We show that at genus zero the $q=-1$ recursion relations yield the
$W_{1+\infty}$ Ward identities for tachyon correlators on the sphere. A scheme
for computing correlation functions of $q=-1$ gravitational descendants is
proposed and applied for the computation of several correlators. It is
suggested that the latter correspond to correlators of discrete states of the
$c=1$ string. In a similar manner to the $q>1$ models, we show that there exist
topological recursion relations for the correlators in the $q=-1$ theory that
consist of only one and two splittings of the Riemann surface. Using a
postulated regularized contact, we prove that the genus one $q=-1$ recursion
relations for tachyon correlators coincide with the $W_{1+\infty}$ Ward
identities on the torus. We argue that the structure of these recursion
relations coincides with that of the $W_{1+\infty}$ Ward identities for any
genus.

the $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction are studied. The first one uses phenomenological
models which reproduce the phase shifts but do not respect the soft-pion
theorems. With increasing density a strong accumulation of strength in the
subhreshold region is observed. Slightly above saturation density there even
occurs an instability with respect to s-wave $\pi$-$\pi$ pair condensation.
These effects are strongly moderated or disappear altogether if constraints
from chiral symmetry are built into the $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction.
