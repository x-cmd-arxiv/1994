  submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, Stockholm Observatory preprint 43",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The radio and X-ray observations of SN 1993J during the first year can be
consistently explained as a result of interaction of the expanding ejecta with
a circumstellar medium. The density of the circumstellar gas can be deduced
from the free-free absorption of the radio emission and from the X-ray
luminosity. During the first two weeks, both sets of observations indicate a
mass loss rate of $\sim 4\EE{-5} \Msun ~\rm yr^{-1}$ for a wind velocity of $10
\kms$. The subsequent radio and X-ray observations indicate a density gradient
$\propto r^{-s}$, with $1.5 \lsim s \lsim 1.7$, as opposed to the $r^{-2}$
gradient expected for a steady, spherically symmetric wind. This may either be
caused by a variation of the mass loss rate from the progenitor system, or by a
non-spherically symmetric geometry. To explain the properties of the X-ray
emission, a steep density gradient in the ejecta is needed. During the first
months most of the observed X-ray emission originates from the circumstellar
shock, which is adiabatic, while the reverse shock is radiative. To avoid
excessive Comptonization in the X-ray range collisionless heating must be
ineffective. The soft X-rays observed at 220 days probably originate from the
reverse shock. The ionization and temperature structures of the circumstellar
gas are calculated; we find that the temperature is in excess of $10^5 \rm~K$
and the medium is nearly completely ionized by the shock radiation after the
formation of the shocks. Preacceleration of the circumstellar gas by the
radiation from the outbreak can explain

chemical potential is moved through the bands or as the temperature is
increased from zero. On the basis of these results we discuss how dc
conductance measurements can provide information on the location and width of
the bands of extended states. Our predictions can be used to demonstrate
experimentally that structural correlations inhibit the localization effects of

limit of a large coupling constant. It is found that the current has a
generalized London term that can originate massive excitations for two of the
three components of the gauge field, which disappear for a free particle at
rest. The origin of the superconductive term is due to a partial breaking of
the gauge symmetry in the limit of a large coupling constant. Beside, the
scalar potential generated by the particle, the only component of the gauge
field that keeps gauge invariance, increases with the square of the distance.
These results should give a path towards the derivation of quark confinement
from QCD.
