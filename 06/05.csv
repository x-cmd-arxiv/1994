reviewed. Galaxies hidden behind the ZOA may have important implications for
the internal dynamics of the Local Group, for the origin of its motion relative
to the Microwave Background, and for the connectivity of the large scale
structure. Current direct (`observational') methods for exploring the ZOA
include eye-balling of plates, source identification in the IRAS data base and
pointed and blind-search observations in 21 cm. Interesting regions identified
so far include the two crossing points of the Supergalactic Plane by the
Galactic Plane (at Galactic longitude $l \sim 135^o$, near Perseus-Pisces, and
$l \sim 315^o$, near the Great Attractor), the Puppis cluster (at $l \sim
240^o, cz \sim 1500$ km/sec) and the Ophiuchus cluster (at $l \sim 0^o, cz \sim
8400$ km/sec). New promising wavelengths are the $2 \mu$ and the X-ray band.
Indirect (`theoretical') approaches include `Wiener reconstruction' from
incomplete and noisy data, and using the peculiar velocity field as a probe of
the mass distribution hidden behind the ZOA. The problem of source confusion at
low Galactic latitude can be addressed by novel statistical methods, e.g.
Artificial Neural Networks.

  UCSBTH-94-16",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.1226",,"cond-mat",,"  A two-dimensional Heisenberg model with random antiferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor exchange is studied using quantum Monte Carlo techniques. As
the strength of the randomness is increased, the system undergoes a transition
from an antiferromagnetically ordered ground state to a gapless disordered
state. The finite-size scaling of the staggered structure factor and
susceptibility is consistent with a dynamic exponent $z = 2$.

black holes are studied. The field equations imply strong restrictions on
boundary values of all fields at the horizon. If the Yang-Mills radial electric
field $E$ is non-zero there, then all fields at the horizon take values in the
centralizer of $E$. For the particular case of SU(3), there are two different
kinds of centralizers: two-dimensional abelian (Cartan subalgebra) and
four-dimensional (su(2)$\times$u(1)) ones. The two-dimensional centralizer
admits only constant fields: even the geometry of the horizon is that of
constant curvature. If the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is negative, a
two-surface of any genus is possible; for positive curvature, only spherically
symmetrical horizons are allowed. For the four-dimensional centralizer, all
spherically symmetrical horizons are explicitly given.

reservoir by introducing arbitrary nonlinear couplings in the particle
coordinates.The equilibrium positions of the heat bath oscillators are promoted
to space-time functions, which are shown to represent a modulation of the
internal noise by the external forces. The model thus provides a description of
classical and quantum dissipation in non homogeneous environments. In the
classical case we derive a generalized Langevin equation with nonlinear
multiplicative noise and a position-dependent fluctuation- dissipation theorem
associated to non homogeneous dissipative forces. When time-modulation of the
noise is present, a new force term is predicted besides the dissipative and
random ones. The model is quantized to obtain the non homogenous influence
functional and master equation for the reduced density matrix of the Brownian
particle. The quantum evolution equations reproduce the correct Langevin
dynamics in the semiclassical limit. The consequences for the issues of
decoherence and localization are discussed.
