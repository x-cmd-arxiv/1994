difficulty coping with it. In fact, the process of ambiguity resolution is
almost always unconscious. But it is not infallible, however, as example 1
demonstrates.
  1. The horse raced past the barn fell.
  This sentence is perfectly grammatical, as is evident when it appears in the
following context:
  2. Two horses were being shown off to a prospective buyer. One was raced past
a meadow. and the other was raced past a barn. ...
  Grammatical yet unprocessable sentences such as 1 are called `garden-path
sentences.' Their existence provides an opportunity to investigate the human
sentence processing mechanism by studying how and when it fails. The aim of
this thesis is to construct a computational model of language understanding
which can predict processing difficulty. The data to be modeled are known
examples of garden path and non-garden path sentences, and other results from
psycholinguistics.
  It is widely believed that there are two distinct loci of computation in
sentence processing: syntactic parsing and semantic interpretation. One
longstanding controversy is which of these two modules bears responsibility for
the immediate resolution of ambiguity. My claim is that it is the latter, and
that the syntactic processing module is a very simple device which blindly and
faithfully constructs all possible analyses for the sentence up to the current
point of processing. The interpretive module serves as a filter, occasionally
discarding certain of these analyses which it deems less appropriate for the
ongoing discourse than their competitors.
  This document is divided into three parts. The first is introductory, and
reviews a selection of proposals from the sentence processing literature. The
second part explores a body of data which has been adduced in support of a
theory of structural preferences --- one that is inconsistent with the present
claim. I show how the current proposal can be specified to account for the
available data, and moreover to predict where structural preference theories
will go wrong. The third part is a theoretical investigation of how well the
proposed architecture can be realized using current conceptions of linguistic
competence. In it, I present a parsing algorithm and a meaning-based ambiguity
resolution method.

intensive VLBI absolute frame measurements. There is a substantial secular
precession of the satellite's line of nodes consistent with the classical,
Newtonian precession due to the non-sphericity of the earth. Ciufolini has
suggested the launch of an identical satellite (LAGEOS-3) into an orbit
supplementary to that of LAGEOS-1: LAGEOS-3 would then experience an equal and
opposite classical precession to that of LAGEOS-1. Besides providing a more
accurate real-time measurement of the earth's length of day and polar wobble,
this paired-satellite experiment would provide the first direct measurement of
the general relativistic frame-dragging effect. Of the five dominant error
sources in this experiment, the largest one involves surface forces on the
satellite, and their consequent impact on the orbital nodal precession. The
surface forces are a function of the spin dynamics of the satellite.

D 50, 7454 (1994)","10.1103/PhysRevD.50.7454",,"hep-th hep-ph",,"  String theory, if it describes nature, is probably strongly coupled. As a
result, one might despair of making any statements about the theory. In the
framework of a set of clearly spelled out assumptions, we show that this is not
necessarily the case. Certain discrete gauge symmetries, combined with
supersymmetry, tightly constrain the form of the effective action. Among our
assumptions are that the true ground state can be obtained from some
perturbative ground state by varying the coupling, and that the actual
numerical value of the low energy field theoretic coupling ${g^2 \over 4\pi}$
is small. It follows that the low energy theory is approximately
supersymmetric; corrections to the superpotential and gauge coupling function
are small, while corrections to the Kahler potential are large; the spectrum of
light particles is the same at strong as at weak coupling. We survey the
phenomenological consequences of this viewpoint. We also note that the string
axion can serve as QCD axion in this framework (modulo cosmological problems).

related to normalization properties of the Green functions in the asymptotic

renormalization group invariance is restricted to the asymptotic region and
consequently mass effects cannot be recoverd by a integration of the
renormalziation group equation. It is shown, that mass independence results in
the limit of a large normalization point, whenever a Callan-Symanzik equation
exists and contains the same differential operators as the renormalization
group equation.

"math/9406217","Haskell P. Rosenthal","Haskell P. Rosenthal","Differences of bounded semi-continuous functions, I",,,,"Banach Archive 6/20/94","math.FA",,"  Structural properties are given for $D(K)$, the Banach algebra of (complex)
differences of bounded semi-continuous functons on a metric space $K$. For
example, it is proved that if all finite derived sets of $K$ are non-empty,
then a complex function $\varphi$ operates on $D(K)$ (i.e., $\varphi\circ f\in
D(K)$ for all $f\in D(K)$) if and only if $\varphi$ is locally Lipschitz.
Another example: if $W\subset K$ and $g\in D(W)$ is real-valued, then it is
proved that $g$ extends to a $\tilde g$ in $D(K)$ with $\|\tilde g\|_{D(K)} =
\|g\|_{D(W)}$. Considerable attention is devoted to $SD(K)$, the closure in
$D(K)$ of the set of simple functions in $D(K)$. Thus it is proved that every
member of $SD(K)$ is a (complex) difference of semi-continuous functions in
$SD(K)$, and that $|f|$ belongs to $SD(K)$ if $f$ does. An intrinsic
characterization of $SD(K)$ is given, in terms of transfinite oscillation sets.
Using the transfinite oscillations, alternate proofs are given of the results
of Chaatit, Mascioni and Rosenthal that functions of finite Baire-index belong
to $SD(K)$, and that $SD(K)\ne D(K)$ for interesting $K$. It is proved that the
``variable oscillation criterion'' characterizes functions belonging to
$B_{1/4}(K)$, thus answering an open problem raised in earlier work of Haydon,
Odell and Rosenthal. It is also proved that $f$ belongs to $B_{1/4}(K)$ (if
and) only if $f$ is a uniform limit of simple $D$-functions of uniformly
bounded $D$-norm iff $\osc_\omega f$ is bounded; the last equivalence has also
been obtained by V.~Farmaki, using other methods.
