equations which we have found to be both robust and efficient, and which has
enabled us to simulate relativistic jets. The technique employs a solver of the
Godunov-type, with approximate solution of the local Riemann problems, applied
to laboratory frame variables. Lorentz transformations provide the rest frame
quantities needed for the estimation of wave speeds, etc. This is applied
within the framework of an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, allowing us to
perform high-resolution, 2-D simulations with modest computing resources. We
present the results of nonrelativistic, and relativistic ($\gamma=5$ and $10$)
runs, for adiabatic indices of $5/3$ and $4/3$. We find the same gross
morphology in all cases, but the relativistic runs exhibit little instability
and less well-defined structure internal to the jet: this might explain the
difference between (relatively slow) BL~Lacs and (faster) QSOs. We find that
the choice of adiabatic index makes a small but discernible difference to the
structure of the shocked jet and ambient media.

a function not only of the positions and sizes of the source and lens, but also
of the wavelength of light. Femtolensing is the only known effect of
$(10^{-13}-10^{-16} M_{\sun})$ dark-matter objects and may possibly be
detectable in cosmological gamma-ray burst spectra. We present a new and
efficient algorithm for femtolensing calculations in general potentials. The
physical-optics results presented here differ at low frequencies from the
semi-classical approximation, in which the flux is attributed to a finite
number of mutually coherent images. At higher frequencies, our results agree
well with the semi-classical predictions. Applying our method to a point-mass
lens with external shear, we find complex events that have structure at both
large and small spectral resolution. In this way, we show that femtolensing may
be observable for lenses up to $10^{-11}$ solar masses, much larger than
previously believed. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of a search for
femtolensing of white dwarfs in the LMC at optical wavelengths.

treated perturbatively. The strength of the perturbation is proportional to

determined by the thermodynamical state of the system (""thermal time

of von Neumann algebras: the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, which allows to derive a
time-flow, namely a one-parameter group of automorphisms of the observable
algebra, from a generic thermal physical state. We study this time-flow, its
classical limit, and we relate it to various characteristic theoretical facts,

symmetry breaking provides not only a mechanism for generating masses of the
bosons and fermions, but also a mechanism for creating CP-phases of the bosons
and fermions, so that CP violation occurs, after spontaneous symmetry breaking,
in all possible ways from a single CP phase of the vacuum and is generally
classified into four types of CP-violating mechanism. A new type of
CP-violating mechanism in the charged Higgs boson interactions of the fermions
is emphasized and can provide a consistent description for both established and
reported CP-, P- and T-violating phenomena. Of particular importance is the new
source of CP violation for charged Higgs boson interactions that lead to the

characters of the general ICFT on simple $g$, noting a simplification for the
subspace of theories which possess a non-trivial symmetry group. Finally, we
give a geometric formulation of the system in which the flat connections are
generalized Laplacians on the centrally-extended loop group.

occurs in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Furthermore, the transition
temperature can be determined from the transverse momentum distribution of the

crossover occurs in the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic matter transition.

compared with free deuteron photodisintegration. Well below and above the Delta
region also some spin observables differ significantly from the ones of free
deuteron disintegration due to the more compressed wave function of the
correlated np pairs in 3He compared to the deuteron. The initial singlet state
causes a significant change in the analyzing power Ay. These differences could
presumably be seen at the conjugate angles where two-body effects are maximized
