  in the Proceedings of the Case Western CMB Meeting, CfPA-TH-94-31",,,,"astro-ph",,"  With the rapidly growing number of cosmic microwave background measurements
on various scales, there is real hope that the number of acceptable models for
structure formation will be limited to a very few in the near future. Yet any
given model can always be saved by introducing and tuning extraneous free
parameters. To better understand this question of ``nature versus nurture'' for
temperature fluctuations, it is useful to know not only the general features of
anisotropy predictions but also their causes. Extracting the physical content
of our other works, we present here a {\it simple} account of cosmic microwave
background anisotropies on all scales. In particular, we show that analytic
approximations can trace the structure of the so-called ``Doppler peaks,''
which arise due to the {\it adiabatic} oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid.
We also show how the finite thickness of the last scattering surface and the
Silk damping mechanism can be described in a unified way by photon diffusion.
In order to present a specific example, we focus on comparing the primordial
isocurvature baryon (PIB) model with the standard cold dark matter model (CDM).
In particular, we explain why PIB generically predicts larger {\it
non}-oscillatory anisotropies from the 1$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$ scale which may
already be in conflict with experiments.

Chromo Dynamics is reviewed. In the context of the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio model
the hidden gauge and massive Yang--Mills approaches to vector mesons are
demonstrated to be linked by a special chiral transformation which removes the
chiral field from the scalar--pseudoscalar sector. The chirally rotated axial
vector meson field ($\tilde A_\mu$) transforms homogeneously under flavor
rotations and may thus be dropped without violating chiral symmetry. The
fermion determinant for static meson field configurations is computed by
summing the discretized eigenvalues of the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is discussed
how the local chiral transformation loses its unitary character in a finite
model space. This technical issue proves to be crucial for the construction of
the soliton within the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio model when the chirally rotated
axial vector field is neglected. In the background of this soliton the valence
quark is strongly bound, and its eigenenergy turns out to be negative. This
important physical property which is usually generated only by non--vanishing

functional method in constant background fields to satisfy Gauss's law and to
simplify the computation. Both the quantum gauge and matter fields are
integrated over. The gauge fixing is achieved with an $R_\xi$-gauge in the
$\xi\to 0$ limit. Divergences appearing in the matter sector are regulated via
operator regularization. We find no corrections to the Chern-Simons coupling
constant and the system experiences conformal symmetry breaking to one-loop
order except at the known value of self-duality. These results agree with
previous analysis of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering.

work of Ashtekar and others that such fields can furnish a complete description
of gravity without matter. We show that conditions ensuring the cancellation of
perturbative chiral gauge anomalies are not disturbed. We also explore a global
anomaly associated with the theory, and argue that its removal requires that
the number of fundamental fermions in the theory must be multiples of 16. In
addition, we investigate the behavior of the theory under discrete
transformations P, C and T; and discuss possible violations of these discrete
symmetries, including CPT, in the presence of instantons and the
Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly.

that dominate nucleon-nucleon collisions, a significant fraction of the
incident center-of-mass energy is radiated through massive bremsstrahlung. In

neutral scalar ($\sigma$) and neutral vector ($\omega$) mesons, which
subsequently decay primarily into pions with some photons also. Additional
