distribution. A well-known theorem from statistics gives the minimum variance
bound (MVB) for the uncertainty in estimating a set of parameters $\l_i$, when
a distribution function $F(z;\l_1 ... \l_m)$ is fit to $N$ observations of the
quantity(ies) $z$. For example, a power-law distribution (of two parameters $A$
and $\gaml$) is $F(z;A,\gaml) = A z^{-\gaml}$. I present the MVB in a form
which is suitable for estimating uncertainties in problems of astrophysical
interest. For many distributions, such as a power-law distribution or an
exponential distribution in the presence of a constant background, the MVB can
be evaluated in closed form. I give analytic estimates for the variances in
several astrophysical problems including the gallium solar-neutrino experiments
and the measurement of the polarization induced by a weak gravitational lens. I
show that it is possible to make significant improvements in the accuracy of
these experiments by making simple adjustments in how they are carried out or
analyzed. The actual variance may be above the MVB because of the form of the
distribution function and/or the number of observations. I present simple
methods for recognizing when this occurs and for obtaining a more accurate
estimate of the variance than the MVB when it does.

particle identification (in terms of $K/\pi$ separation) is of crucial
importance for studying $CP$ violation in these modes. Another kind of
``charmless"" final state is also emphasized: $b\to dc\bar c$. The decay rate is
tree dominant, while ``$q^2$"" is necessarily above $c\bar c$ threshold hence in
the domain of perturbative QCD. The $CP$ asymmetry is therefore relatively
clean and reliable. Theoretically, a few $\times 10^7$ $B$'s would suffice if

Calabi-Yau manifold of Tian and Yau. Our analysis includes the complete
$E_6$-singlet sector, which has been recently evaluated using techniques of
spectral and exact sequences. We use the discrete symmetries of the models to
find flat directions of symmetry breaking that leave unbroken a low energy
matter parity and make all leptoquarks heavy while preserving light Higgs
fields. Then we classify the patterns of ordinary quark mass matrices and show
that (without invoking effects due to nonrenormalizable terms) only one
structure can accommodate the observed value of fermion masses and mixing
angles, with preference for a heavy {\it top} quark ( $m_t\ge 170$ GeV for
$V_{13}\le 0.013$ ). The model, which unifies perturbatively and predicts a
realistic structure of quark mass matrices with texture zeroes, is one of the
many possible string vacua. However, in contrast with what is often assumed in
the search for realistic unified scenarios, it is highly nonminimal near the
unification scale and the predicted mass matrices have no simple symmetry
properties.

on this extension. We compute the Lie algebra of the central extension in terms
of logarithmic symbols. The main tool is a new trace-type functional defined on
classical PDOs of non-integer orders. A canonical det of elliptic PDOs
