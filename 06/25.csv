within two extreme alternate scenarios for their possible origin: 1) the
accretion of groups (or small clusters) on quasi-radial orbits, and 2) the
merger of clusters of similar masses, followed by the decoupling of their dense
cores. Using simple analytical arguments and checking with numerical
computations, we show that objects are destroyed by the tidal field of the
global cluster potential if their mean density is small compared to the mean
cluster density within the radius of closest approach of the group or detached
core. Accreted groups and small clusters are thus tidally disrupted in one
cluster crossing. Since the cores of clusters are much denser than groups, they
are considerably more robust to tides, but the least massive are destroyed or
severely stripped by tides, while the others are brought to the cluster center
by dynamical friction (and subsequently merge) in less than one orbit. The
longest lived substructures are detached cores, roughly ten times less massive
than the cluster, starting in near-circular orbits beyond $1 \, h^{-1} \, \rm
Mpc$ from the cluster center.

constraints of p-stability and COBE data .For case 1 it is found that the CLEO
II data on the branching ratio already imposes very strong further constraints
on dark matter analyses. For case2 the branching ratio is found to lie in the
range (1.5-6.3)x$10^{-4}$ and thus the data does not at present significantly
limit the analyses with p-stability constraint. It is shown that improvements
by a factor of 3 in the $p \rightarrow\bar\nu K^{+}$ lifetime will reduce SUSY
effects to less than O(30$\%$) of the Standard Model value.For case3,the
branching ratio lies in the interval (3.1-5.3)x$10^{-4}$, and the SUSY effects
lie within (-10$\%$,+50$\%$) of the SM value. Thus as experimental bounds on

Polarization tensors relevant in the quantum Hall effect and anyon

density is evaluated in the random phase approximation (RPA), by summing an
infinite series of ring diagrams. It is found that the correction has
significant dependence on the particle number density.
  In the context of anyon superconductivity, the energy density relative to the
mean field value is minimized at a hole concentration per lattice plaquette
(0.05 \sim 0.06) (p_c a/\hbar)^2 where p_c and a are the momentum cutoff and
lattice constant, respectively. At the minimum the correction is about -5 %

frequency cutoff.
  In the Jain-Fradkin-Lopez picture of the fractional quantum Hall effect the
RPA correction to the energy density is very large. It diverges logarithmically
as the cutoff is removed, implying that corrections beyond RPA become important
