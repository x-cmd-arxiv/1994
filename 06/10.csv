collapse are used to extend the well-known Press \& Schechter (PS) approach, in
order to determine analytical expressions for the mass function of cosmic
structures. The problem is rigorously set up by considering the intrinsic
Lagrangian nature of the mass function. The Lagrangian equations of motion of a
cold and irrotational fluid in single-stream regime show that the shear, which
is non-locally determined by all the matter field, is the quantity which
characterizes non-spherical perturbations. The Zel'dovich approximation, being
a self-consistent first-order Lagrangian and local one, is used as a suitable
guide to develop realistic estimates of the collapse time of a mass clump,
starting from the local initial values of density and shear. Both
Zel'dovich-based \an\ and models and the homogeneous ellipsoidal model predict
that more large-mass objects are expected to form than the usual PS relation.
In particular, the homogeneous ellipsoid model is consistent at large masses
with a Press \& Schechter mass function with a lower value of the \dc\
parameter, in the range 1.4$\div$1.6. This gives a dynamical explanation of why
lower \dc\ values have been found to fit the results of several N-body
simulations. When more small-scale structure is present, highly non-linear
dynamical effects can effectively slow down the collapse rate of a
perturbation, increasing the effective value of \dc. This may have interesting
consequences on the abundance of large-mass high-redshift objects.

  in the Cluster of Galaxies A2218","12 pages, Postcript file",,"10.1086/187606",,"astro-ph",,"  The central mass distribution of clusters of galaxies can be inferred from
gravitationally lensed arcs with known redshifts. For the Abell cluster 2218,
this method yields a core mass which is larger by a factor of $2.5 \pm 0.5$
than the value deduced from X-ray observations, under the assumptions that the
gas is supported by thermal pressure and that the cluster is spherical. We show
that a non-thermal pressure support is the most plausible explanation for this
discrepancy. Such a pressure can be naturally provided by strong turbulence and
equipartition magnetic fields ($\sim 50\mu$G) that are tangled on small spatial
scales (<10 kpc). The turbulent and magnetic pressures do not affect the
measured Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for this cluster. Intracluster magnetic
fields with a comparable magnitude ($\sim 10^{1-2} \mu$G) have already been
detected by Faraday rotation in other clusters. If generic, a small-scale
equipartition magnetic field should affect the structure of cooling flows and
must be included in X-ray determinations of cluster masses.

A27 (1994) 7373-7386","10.1088/0305-4470/27/22/013",,"hep-th",,"  The algebraic structure of the Green's ansatz is analyzed in such a way that
its generalization to the case of q-deformed para-Bose and para-Fermi operators
is becoming evident. To this end the underlying Lie (super)algebraic properties
of the parastatistics are essentially used.

motion in a harmonic oscillator potential which is characterized by a
quadrupole deformation and an additional octupole deformation. The chaotic
character of the motion is srongly dependent on the quadrupole deformation in
that for a prolate deformation virtually no chaos is discernible while for the
oblate case the motion shows strong chaos when the octupole term is turned on.
