epochs. The amplitude of the effect depends on the evolution model assumed for

double sided jet with bulk flow velocity of about 0.5 c and incident beam
radiation with a hard energy spectrum. We show that the two lines can be seen
at viewing angle cosines relative to the jet ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. This

approximately 10\% polarized. Depending on the bulk flow and viewing angle the

can also accommodate single line spectra if the beamed gamma ray emission or

formation. Photoionization by UV radiation decreases the cooling rate of the
gas in halos, so that objects with only large density contrasts can self-shield
against the background radiation, thereby allowing the shielded neutral cores
to cool and form stars. In the context of the CDM model, we use the criterion
that self-shielding is essential for star formation to calculate the mass
function of galaxies based on both Press-Schechter and the peaks formalisms.
The ionizing UV radiation results in the inhibition of galaxy formation --- we
show the decrease in the number density of the galaxies quantitatively. We also
find that the merging in general is made inefficient by the UV photons through
photoionization of the gas in the bigger system into which small objects are
incorporated. The latter means that, in a merging dominated region, where the
number density at the low-mass end ($M_b \la 10^{10}M_{\odot}$) is usually
expected to decrease with time, the trend is {\it reversed} (the number of
low-mass galaxies is more at lower redshifts $z$) due to the decreasing UV flux
with time after $z \sim 2$. We further discuss the implication of our results
for the number counts of galaxies and possible evolution of the luminosity
function of the galaxies.

gamma-ray bursts in a nearby, bounded distribution. While both models can
explain the average amount of time stretching, we find a generic difference
between them in the way the duration distribution of faint bursts deviates from
that of bright ones. This allows us to distinguish between these two broad
classes of model on the basis of the duration distributions of gamma-ray

this allows us to study the quantum properties of subfamilies which span the

constant degree of chaoticity (Kolmogorov entropy). In the regime of hard chaos
we find that the statistical properties of interest are well-described by
random-matrix theory and completely insensitive to the particular shape of the
dot. However in the nearly-integrable regime non-universal behavior is found.
Specifically, the level-width distribution is well-described by the predicted
$\chi^2$ distribution both in the presence and absence of magnetic flux when
the system is fully chaotic; however it departs substantially from this
behavior in the mixed regime. The chaotic behavior corroborates the previously
predicted behavior of the peak-height distribution for deformed quantum dots.

on lattices from $6^4$ to $16^4$. We argue that a lattice with this fixed
boundary imposition corresponds actually to a lattice with spherical topology.
We have found the presence of a phase transition without any trace of
discontinuity. Moreover, the specific heat and the Binder cumulant are
qualitatively consistent with a second order phase transition. The implications
of this observation on the nature of the compact lattice QED are discussed.

effects from a longitudinally expanding plasma on medium as well as high energy
jets are found to be significant at both RHIC and LHC energies. Because jets
escape from the plasma long before the completion of mixed phase, these effects
are free from complications of final state hadronic interactions and decays.
These suggest that jets can be used to probe the plasma that might be created
in future high energy heavy ion collisions.

as a transition from a disordered instanton liquid to a strongly correlated
phase of polarized instanton anti-instanton molecules. We find a number of non
perturbative effects caused by the presence of instantons above T_c, among them
the fact that instantons contribute to the euquation of state. We also study
how instantons affect the propagation of light quarks at high temperature and
determine the spacelike screening masses for mesons and baryons. We derive the
corresponding effective interaction and find that the interaction in the
scalar-pseudoscalar channel is attractive and four times stronger than the one
in the vector-axial-vector channel, in agreement with recent lattice QCD
simulations.

SLAC have obtained structure function measurements off proton, neutron and
deuteron targets at a level of precision never before achieved. The
measurements can be used to test the Bjorken and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules, and
also to obtain information on the parton distributions in polarized nucleons.
We perform a global leading-order QCD fit to the proton deep inelastic data in
order to extract the spin-dependent parton distributions. By using parametric
forms which are consistent with theoretical expectations at large and small
$x$, we find that the quark distributions are now rather well constrained. We
assume that there is no significant intrinsic polarization of the strange quark
sea. The data are then consistent with a modest amount of the proton's spin
carried by the gluon, although the shape of the gluon distribution is not well
constrained, and several qualitatively different shapes are suggested. The
spin-dependent distributions we obtain can be used as input to phenomenological
studies for future polarized hadron-hadron and lepton-hadron colliders.
