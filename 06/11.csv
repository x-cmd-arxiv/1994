suggested a mechanism for gamma-ray bursts which requires that stars be
captured by a neutrino ball. Neutrino balls would be, for the most part, denser
than main sequence stars, but their density would decrease as their mass
increased. We show that small neutrino balls would subject stars to tidal
forces sufficient to disrupt them. We thus argue that if neutrino balls existed
at the centres of galaxies, only the largest would be able to act as a source
of gamma-ray bursts. Such neutrino balls would have a mass of order
$10^7\Msun$. Tidal capture of stars by a neutrino ball would not be important,
but dynamical friction against the neutrinos or star-disc interactions could
both be important capture mechanisms. We find that a gamma-ray burst would
occur in a galaxy containing such a neutrino ball roughly every $10^2\y$, and
the fraction of all galaxies contributing to the gamma-ray burst flux would be
$\sim 10^{-4}$, assuming that this was the mechanism of all gamma-ray bursts.
These numbers have implications for neutrino ball models of active galaxies,
assuming that all gamma-ray bursts and all AGN come from neutrino balls. Either
a small fraction $\sim 10^{-2}$ of the lifetime of such an object could be
spent as an AGN, or that the probability of a neutrino ball becoming an AGN
would be $10^{-2}$. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that
neutrino balls might exist at the centres of galaxies through direct
ground-based observation of stellar kinematics.

of close binary systems using the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
technique. We adopt a simple polytropic equation of state $p=K\rho^\gam$ with
$\gam=5/3$ and $K=\,$constant within each star, applicable to low-mass
degenerate dwarfs as well as low-mass main-sequence stars. Along a sequence of
binary equilibrium configurations for two identical stars, we demonstrate the
existence of both secular and dynamical instabilities, confirming directly the
results of recent analytic work. We use the SPH method to calculate the
nonlinear development of the dynamical instability and to determine the final
fate of the system. We find that the two stars merge together into a single,
rapidly rotating object in just a few orbital periods. Equilibrium sequences
are also constructed for systems containing two nonidentical stars. These
sequences terminate at a Roche limit, which we can determine very accurately
using SPH. For two low-mass main-sequence stars with mass ratio $q\lo0.4$ we
find that the (synchronized) Roche limit configuration is secularly unstable.
Degenerate binary configurations remain hydrodynamically stable all the way to
the Roche limit for all mass ratios $q\ne1$. Dynamically unstable mass transfer
can also lead to the rapid coalescence of a binary system, but the details of
the hydrodynamic evolution are quite different. We discuss the implications of
our results for double white-dwarf and W Ursae Majoris systems.

pulse timing measurements with microsecond precision, the orbit evolution would
lead to a measurable modulation of the arrival times of the pulses. Detection
of this effect would serve to corroborate the planetary interpretation of the
data and provide additional constraints on the system. The theory of planetary
perturbations in the context of pulsar timing observations is summarized here.

simulations has advanced rapidly in the past few years. The simplest approach -
modeling a cluster as collisionless dark matter and collisonal, non--radiative
gas is now fairly well established. One of the most fruitful results of this
approach is the {\sl morphology--cosmology connection} for X-ray clusters.
Simulations have provided the means to make concrete predictions for the X-ray
morphologies of clusters in cosmologies with different $\Omega_o$, with the
result that low $\Omega_o$ cosmologies fair rather poorly when compared to
observations. Another result concerns the accuracy of \xray binding mass
estimates. The standard, hydrostatic, isothermal model estimator is found to be
accurate to typically better than $50\%$ at radii where the density contrast is
between $10^2$ and $10^3$. More complicated approaches, which attempt to
explicitly follow galaxy formation within the proto--cluster environment are
slowly being realized. The key issue of {\sl dynamical biasing} of the galaxy
population within a cluster is being probed, but conclusive answers are
lacking. The dynamics of multi--phase gas, including conversion of cold, dense
gas into stars and the feedback therefrom, is the largest obstacle hindering
progress. An example demonstrating the state--of--the--art in this area is
presented.

electronegativity equalization according to which: (a) The electronegativity of
an atomic site is dependent on the atom's type and charge and is perturbed by
the electrostatic potential it experiences from its neighbors and (b) Charge is
transferred between atomic sites in such a way that electronegativities are
equalized. The charges are treated as dynamical variables using an extended
Lagrangian method in which the charges are given a fictitious mass, velocities
and kinetic energy and then propagated according to Newtonian mechanics along
with the atomic degrees of freedom. Models for water with fluctuating charges
are developed using the geometries of two common fixed-charge water potentials:
the simple point charge (SPC) and the 4-point transferable intermolecular
potential (TIP4P). Both fluctuating charge models give accurate predictions for
gas-phase and liquid state properties, including radial distribution functions,
the dielectric constant, and the diffusion constant. The method does not
introduce any new intermolecular interactions beyond those already present in
the fixed charge models and increases the computer time by only a factor of
1.1, making this method tractable for large systems.

the distribution of conductance peaks in the resonance regime. At intermediate
