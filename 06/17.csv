of solving for the evolution of a two-fluid model until the epoch of
recombination and then integrating over the sources to obtain the CMB
anisotropy power spectrum. The approximation is useful both for a physical
understanding of CMB anisotropies, as well as for a quantitative analysis of
cosmological models. Comparison with exact calculations shows that the accuracy
is typically better than 20 percent over a large range of angles and
cosmological models, including those with curvature and cosmological constant.
Using this approximation we investigate the dependence of the CMB anisotropies
on the cosmological parameters. We identify six dimensionless parameters that
uniquely determine the anisotropy power spectrum within our approximation. CMB
experiments on different angular scales could in principle provide information
on all these parameters. In particular, mapping of the Doppler peaks would
allow an independent determination of baryon mass density, matter mass density
and Hubble constant.

a spherical system $M(r)$ is calculated using the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics

  $\Delta\phi(r_0)=2\int_{r_0}^{\infty}
  \frac{v^2(r)}{c^2}\frac{r_0dr}{r\sqrt{r^2-r_0^2}}$, where

acceleration $a_0$. In the Newtonian limit of the gravitational acceleration
$a\gg a_0$, $\Delta\phi$ approaches $\Delta\phi=2Gm(r_0)/c^2r_0$ with the
projected surface mass $m(r_0)$. Whilst the asymptotic value of $\Delta\phi$
reaches a constant $\pi(v_{\infty}/c)^2$ in the low-acceleration limit of $a\ll

  Taking the empirical correction of a factor of 2 from the theory of general

$v$ and velocity dispersion $\sigma$, MOND results naturally in a constant
deflection angle, $4\pi(\sigma/c)^2$, which has been widely used in the

possible to map the mass distribution of the cluster. The method is shown to be
limited by discreteness noise and galaxy clustering behind the lens. Galaxy
clustering sets a lower limit to the error along the redshift direction, but a
clustering independent lensing signature may be obtained from the magnitude
distribution at fixed redshift. Statistical techniques are developed for
estimating the surface mass density of the cluster. We extend these methods to
account for any obscuration by cluster halo dust, which may be mapped
independently of the dark matter. We apply the method to a series of numerical

particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The spatial resolution in SPH is determined by
the smoothing length, $h$, and it has become common practice for each particle
to be given its own adaptive smoothing length, $h_i$. Consequently, the dynamic
range that may be spatially resolved is greatly increased, but additional
($\nabla h$) terms, which account for the variability of the smoothing lengths,
should appear in the equations of motion in order to satisy conservation
requirements. Previous implementations of SPH have neglected these additional
terms, whereas we have included them. This is achieved by defining a functional
form for the $h_i$s, that depends on inter-particle distances only, and then
deriving the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian formalism. A number of
test calculations are presented. We find that including the $\nabla h$ terms
has no detrimental effect on the ability of SPH to model known problems with
reasonable accuracy. For problems where the energy conservation was rather
poor, including the $\nabla h$ terms results in a dramatic improvement. In
particluar non-conservation of energy during a collision between two polytropes
can occur at the level of 10% when the $\nabla h$ terms are neglected. When the
$\nabla h$ terms are included, then this error reduces to 0.8%.

particularly suitable for determining asymptotic properties of periodic orbits
which are essential for scrutinizing the semiclassical limit of Gutzwiller's
semiclassical trace formula. The Sinai billiard is used as model system. In

indicate how likely it is that a certain word will be spoken next, given the

that more complex speech recognition tasks can be tackled? Since the knowledge
of the weaknesses of any theory often makes improving the theory easier, the
central idea of this thesis is to analyze the weaknesses of existing
statistical language models in order to subsequently improve them. To that end,
we formally define a weakness of a statistical language model in terms of the
logarithm of the total probability, LTP, a term closely related to the standard
perplexity measure used to evaluate statistical language models. We apply our
definition of a weakness to a frequently used statistical language model,
called a bi-pos model. This results, for example, in a new modeling of unknown
words which improves the performance of the model by 14% to 21%. Moreover, one
of the identified weaknesses has prompted the development of our generalized
N-pos language model, which is also outlined in this thesis. It can incorporate
linguistic knowledge even if it extends over many words and this is not
feasible in a traditional N-pos model. This leads to a discussion of
whatknowledge should be added to statistical language models in general and we
give criteria for selecting potentially useful knowledge. These results show
the usefulness of both our definition of a weakness and of performing an
analysis of weaknesses of statistical language models in general.

measurement settings. The assumption has sometimes been questioned, but the
suggestion has been thought outlandish, even by the taxed standards of the
discipline. (Bell thought that it led to fatalism.) The case for this reaction
turns out to be surprisingly weak, however. We show that QM easily evades the
standard objections to advanced action. And the approach has striking
advantages, especially in avoiding the apparent conflict between Bell's Theorem
and special relativity.
  The second part of the paper considers the broader question as to why
advanced action seems so counterintuitive. We investigate the origins of our
ordinary intuitions about causal asymmetry. It is argued that the view that the
past does not depend on the future is largely anthropocentric, a kind of
projection of our own temporal asymmetry. Many physicists have also reached
this conclusion, but have thought that if causation has no objective direction,
there is no objective content to an advanced action interpretation of QM. This
turns out to be a mistake. From the ordinary subjective perspective, we can
distinguish two sorts of objective world: one ""looks as if"" it contains only
forward causation, the other ``looks as if'' it involves a mix of backward and
forward causation. This clarifies the objective core of an advanced action
interpretation of QM, and shows that there is an independent symmetry argument
in favour of the approach.

for quantum gravity is that the notion of ``spacelike'' is ill-defined in a
theory where the metric itself is behaving quantum-mechanically. Spacetime
coarse grainings--sets of alternatives defined with respect to a region
extended in time as well as space--have previously been considered in the
quantum mechanics of a single nonrelativistic particle. This work examines
spacetime coarse grainings in the quantum mechanics of a free *relativistic*
particle, not as a theory for real particles (which are described by quantum
field theory) but as a simple reparametrization-invariant theory which may
model some features of quantum gravity.
  We use Hartle's sum-over-histories generalized quantum mechanics formalism,
in which probabilities are assigned to a set of alternatives if they decohere,
i.e., if the quantum-mechanical interference between their branches of the
initial state is nearly zero. For one extremely simple set of alternatives, we
calculate these branches. Despite the nonlocality of the positive-definite
version of the Klein-Gordon inner product, some initial conditions are found to
give decoherence and allow the consistent assignment of probabilities.

phase transition of the electroweak theory. It is obtained by dimensional
reduction of the $3+1$ dimensional full theory and by subsequent integration
over all static gauge degrees of freedom. The resulting theory corresponds to a
$3$-dimensional $O(4)$ ferromagnet containing cubic and quartic terms of the
field in its potential function. Possible nonperturbative effects of a magnetic
screening mass are parametrically included in the potential. We analyse the
theory using mean field and numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methods. At
the value of the physical Higgs mass, $m_H=37~{\rm GeV}$, considered in the
present investigation, we find a discontinuous symmetry restoring phase
transition. We determine the critical temperature, order parameter jump,
interface tension and latent heat characteristics of the transition. The Monte
Carlo results indicate a somewhat weaker first order phase transition as
compared to the mean field treatment, demonstrating that non-perturbative
fluctuations of the Higgs field are relevant. This effect is especially
important for the interface tension. Any observation of hard first order
transition could result only from non-perturbative effects related to the gauge
degrees of freedom.
