with the latest statistical constraints on faint galaxy redshifts from
gravitational lensing studies, which imply that the bulk of the r<26 field
galaxies should be at redshifts of order 1. Our derived $A$ is significantly
lower than that predicted from the local bright galaxy correlation function
using the lensing-determined galaxy redshift distribution and modest growth of
clustering. This simplistic model does not include the variation in observed
morphological mix as a function of redshift and apparent magnitude in our
sample. At our faintest limits we reach sufficiently high redshifts that
differential $K$ corrections will result in the observed galaxy mix being
dominated by star bursting dwarf and low surface brightness irregulars, rather
than the early-type systems used to define the local bright galaxy correlation
function. Adopting the correlation function measured locally for these low
surface brightness galaxies and assuming modest clustering evolution, we obtain
reasonable agreement between our model and observations. This model supports
the scenario in which the high number density of faint galaxies is produced by
normally clustered star forming dwarf galaxies at modest redshifts.

We find that clusters of galaxies are efficient tracers of the large-scale
velocity field. The clusters exhibit a Maxwellian distribution of peculiar
velocities, as expected from Gaussian initial density fluctuations. The cluster
3-D velocity distribution for the $\Omega=0.3$ model peaks at $v \sim 400$ km
s$^{-1}$, and extends to high velocities of $v \sim 1200$ km s$^{-1}$. The rms
peculiar velocity of the clusters is $440$ km s$^{-1}$. Approximately 10\% of
all model clusters move with high peculiar velocities of $v \ge 700$ km
s$^{-1}$. The observed velocity distribution of clusters of galaxies is
compared with the predictions from cosmological models. The observed data
exhibit a larger velocity tail than seen in the model simulations; however, due
to the large observational uncertainties, the data are consistent at a $\sim
3\sigma$ level with the model predictions, and with a Gaussian initial density
field. The large peculiar velocities reported for some clusters of galaxies ($v
\geq 3000$ km s$^{-1}$) are likely to be overestimated, if the current model is
viable.

is uniformly distributed except for a spherical hole. Negative pressure caused
by negative gravity is utilized. The physical significance of the cosmological

a natural explanation: minimising with respect to the Yukawas amounts to a
minimisation with respect to the underlying moduli fields and a constraint on
the Yukawas of the type of the Veltman condition may be attributed to the
relaxation process to a phenomenologically viable string vacuum.

while keeping a consistent description of hard photon emission. We apply this
method to the process e+ e- --> mu+ mu- + n photons where we include both Z^0
and photon exchange and retain the muon mass dependence. The photonic radiation
is allowed to be radiated off any charged leg, and so we include all initial
and final state radiation, as well as all interference effects. The effect of
exponentiation is to suppress soft photon emission over the cross-section you
would obtain from working at strictly leading order. We also show how one would
extend the method to treat the collinear singularity; and remove the associated
leading mass logarithms.
