divergence of initially nearby trajectories. For Hamiltonian systems the
exponents are related to the eigenvalues of a symplectic matrix. We make use of
this fact to develop a new method for the calculation of Lyapunov exponents of
such systems. Our approach avoids the renormalization and reorthogonalization
of usual techniques. It is also easily extendible to damped systems. We apply
our method to two examples of physical interest: a model system that describes
the beam halo in charged particle beams and the driven van der Pol oscillator.

configuration, velocity, and energy space moments associated with these
perturbations exhibit a simple scaling in the amplitude of the friction and
noise. (2) Even very weak friction and noise can induce an extrinsic diffusion
through cantori on a time scale much shorter than that associated with
intrinsic diffusion in the unperturbed system.

  Suppression in $pA$ Collisions","26 pages, 15 figures (not included, hard copy available upon
  request), report # KANSAS 94-5-22",,,,"hep-ph nucl-th",,"  We study the energy and nuclear A dependence of the hadronic production of
heavy quarkonia. We review theoretical ideas which have been put forward,
seeking a consistent global picture reconciling the large effects in quarkonia
with the small nuclear effects observed in continuum Drell Yan production. The
data indicates that shadowing or leading twist modifications of parton
distributions can be ruled out as explanations, leaving higher twist energy
loss. {}From general principles the maximum allowed energy loss of partons
traversing the nuclear medium can be related to the parton transverse momenta.
We then show that the experimental data on nuclear suppression of charm- and
bottom- onium for large $x_F$ is consistent with this effect: using the
observed transverse momenta to bound the $x_F$ dependence in an almost model
independent manner generates a relation that practically reproduces the data.
Several prediction are discussed; the dependence on $x_F$ as $x_F\to 1$, and
large and small $k_T^2$ cuts, can be used to discriminate between quark and
gluon induced effects.

to suppress backgrounds from transverse $W$, $Z$ production we show that the

environment. Describing the $\lam$ as a $K^-$ proton bound state, we find, that
due to the Pauli blocking of intermediate states, the mass of the $\Lambda
(1405)$ is shifted upwards in energy, above the $K^-$ proton threshold and and
its width is somewhat broadened. As a consequence the s-wave $K^-$--nucleon
scattering length turns attractive at finite nucleon density ($\rho \geq 0.25
\rho_0$) leading to a mean field potential for the $K^-$ of about $\sim -100 \,
\rm MeV$ in nuclear matter at ground state density. Consequences for Heavy Ion
collisions and possible experimental checks for the structure of the $\lam$ are
discussed. (Figures will be sent on request)
