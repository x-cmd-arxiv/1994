Mumford had proved that, for each fixed genus $g$, there are isomorphisms

obtain a coherent, genus-independent description of the Mumford isomorphisms

these universal $DET$ and Hodge line bundles on this direct limit, equips them
with their Quillen metrics, and proves that they are related by the appropriate
Mumford isomorphisms. Our work can be viewed as a contribution towards a
non-perturbative formulation of the bosonic string theory, since it provides an
interpretation of the Polyakov measure in a genus-independent fashion.

properties of disk galaxies over timescales of a few billion years. The models
employ a Schmidt law of index $n\sim 1.5$ to calculate star formation rates,

Modeling the newly formed stellar population is achieved through the use of
hybrid SPH/young star particles which gradually convert from gaseous to
collisionless particles, avoiding the computational difficulties involved in
creating new particles. The models are shown to reproduce well the star forming
properties of disk galaxies, such as the morphology, rate of star formation,
and evolution of the global star formation rate and disk gas content. As an
example of the technique, we model an encounter between a disk galaxy and a
small companion which gives rise to a ring galaxy reminiscent of the Cartwheel
(AM 0035-35). The primary galaxy in this encounter experiences two phases of
star forming activity: an initial period during the expansion of the ring, and
a delayed phase as shocked material in the ring falls back into the central
regions.

proof in Liu Shelah [LiSh:484] and is proved consistent as required there. A
natural property which looks better, not only is not obtained here, but is
shown to be false. On earlier related theorems see Gitik Shelah [GiSh310].

  (1) a set X subseteq 2^omega is null-additive if for every Lebesgue null set
A subseteq 2^omega, X+A is null too;
  (2) we say that X subseteq 2^omega is meager-additive if for every A subseteq
2^omega which is meager also X+A is meager.

random real. In particular, we show that the number of measure zero subsets of
the plane which are necessary to cover graphs of all continuous functions maybe
large while the covering for measure is small.
