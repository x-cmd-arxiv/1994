localized averages (SOLA) method is a modified version of the Backus-Gilbert

maximum-entropy method. The SOLA method has been developed for use in
helioseismology. It has been applied to the solar oscillation frequency
splitting data currently available to deduce the internal rotation rate of the
sun. The original SOLA method is reformulated in the present paper to cope with
the slightly different problem of inverting time series. We use simulations to
test the viability of the method and apply the SOLA method to the real data of
the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 5548. We investigate the effects of measurement errors
and how the resolution of the TF critically depends upon both the sampling rate

  TeX",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In this review we report on advances in topological soliton models of the
nucleon. In chapter I we construct an effective lagrangian of QCD with the low
mass mesons ($\pi,\rho,A_1$ and the scalar meson $\epsilon$) generalising the
Skyrme model. The vector meson fields are introduced as massive gauge fields in
the linear sigma model and we look for topological soliton solutions of the
model. The results for the nucleon-nucleon interaction show that the scalar
degrees of freedom give rise to attractive intermediate range forces. This is
in sharp contrast to models incorporating vector degrees of freedom where only
repulsive forces are found. In chapter II we evaluate the leading correction to
the classical Skyrmion mass. The main ultraviolet divergence is cancelled by
well known chiral counterterms. The low energy behaviour of the phase shifts
which are large and positive dominates the result. As a consequence, the
correction is found to be negative and rather large, of the order of 1 GeV for
the original Skyrme model. We then show that the situation improves if one
introduces higher chiral orders in the effective lagrangian. The problem of the
stability of topological solitons when vector fields enter the chiral

  UdeM-LPN-TH-94-199",,"10.1063/1.48531",,"hep-ph",,"  I review the many ways of obtaining information about the CKM matrix through
CP violation in the $B$ system. I include direct and indirect CP violation, the
role of penguins and isospin analysis, tagging, and $B\to DK$ decays. I also
discuss recent developments showing how to use $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, along
with some dynamical approximations, to extract from $B$ decays to $\pi\pi$,
$\pi K$ and $K\kbar$ the weak CKM phases, the strong phase shifts, and the
sizes of the various contributing diagrams. Finally, I briefly show what can be
learned from an exact treatment of the CKM matrix. (Talk given at the 5th

related to all the fundamental representations of $Y(X_r)$. Under the Bethe
ansatz equation, we explicitly prove that they are pole-free, a crucial
property in the ansatz. Conjectures are also given on higher representation
cases by applying the $T$-system, the transfer matrix functional relations
proposed recently. The eigenvalues are neatly described in terms of Yangian
analogues of the semi-standard Young tableaux.

from a variational principle. During evolution, the quasiclassical variables
become entangled with the quantum variables with the result that the value of
the quasiclassical variables depends on the quantum state. This provides a
formalism to compute the backreaction of any quantum system on a quasiclassical
one. In particular, it leads to a natural candidate for a theory of gravity
coupled to quantized matter in which the gravitational field is not quantized.

modified Lorentz invariance and supersymmetry and reduces to the usual form
