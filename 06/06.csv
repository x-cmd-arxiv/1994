of Avoidance is presented. It also corrects for shot-noise and for redshift
distortion in galaxy surveys. The galaxy distribution is expanded in an
orthogonal set of spherical harmonics. We show that in the framework of
Bayesian statistics and Gaussian random fields the $4 \pi$ harmonics can be
recovered and the shot-noise can be suppressed, giving the optimal picture of
the underlying density field. The correction factor from observed to
reconstructed harmonics turns out to be the well-known Wiener filter (the ratio
of signal to signal+noise), which is also derived by requiring minimum
variance. We apply the method to the 1.2 Jy IRAS survey. A reconstruction of
the projected galaxy distribution confirms the connectivity of the
Supergalactic Plane across the Galactic Plane (at Galactic longitude $l \sim
135^o$ and $l \sim 315^o$) and the Puppis cluster behind the Galactic Plane ($
l \sim 240^o$). The method is extended to 3-D, and is used to recover from the
1.2 Jy redshift survey the density, velocity and potential fields in the local
universe.

  size","Astron.Astrophys.296:575,1995",,,"astro-ph",,"  This paper deals with the time evolution in the matter era of perturbations
in Friedman-Lemaitre models with arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$, with
either a zero cosmological constant, $\Lambda = 0$, or with a non-zero
cosmological constant in a spatially flat Universe. Unlike the classical
Eulerian approach where the density contrast is expanded in a perturbative
series, this analysis relies instead on a perturbative expansion of particles
trajectories in Lagrangian coordinates. This brings a number of advantages over
the classical analysis. In particular, it enables the description of stronger
density contrasts. Indeed the linear term is the famous Zel'dovich approximate
solution (1970). We present here a systematic and detailed account of this
approach. We give analytical results (or fits to numerical results) up to the
third order. We then proceed to explore the link between the lagrangian
description and statistical measures. We show in particular that Lagrangian
perturbation theory provides a natural framework to compute the effect of
redshift distortions, using the skewness of the density distribution function
as an example. Finally, we show how well the second order theory does as
compared to other approximat- ions in the case of spherically symmetric
perturbations. We also compare this second order approximation and Zel'dovich
solution to N-body simulations in the description of large-scale structure
formation starting from a power law (n=-2) power spectrum of Gaussian
perturbation. We find that second order theory is both simple and powerful.

presented in the frame of physically motivated inflationary models (natural,

in agreement with estimated quantities from large angle scale (e.g., {\em COBE}

lie below the level of theoretical uncertainty (cosmic variance). The

orthorhombic phase of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. It splits the degeneracy of the
van Hove singularities (thereby stabilizing the distorted phase) and completely
changes the shape of the Fermi surfaces, potentially introducing diabolical
points into the band structure. The present paper gives a detailed account of
the resulting electronic structure.
  A slave boson calculation shows how these results are modified in the
presence of strong correlation effects. A scaling regime, found very close to
the metal-insulator transition, allows an analytical determination of the
crossover, in the limit of zero oxygen-oxygen hopping, $t_{OO}\rightarrow 0$.
Extreme care must exercised in chosing the parameters of the three-band model.
In particular, $t_{OO}$ is renormalized from its LDA value. Furthermore, it is
suggested that the slave boson model be spin-corrected, in which case the
system is close to a metal-insulator transition at half filling.
