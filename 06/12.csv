by using the techniques developed in the heavy quark effective theory. The
leading logarithmic quark mass terms emerging from the loop contributions are
explicitly extracted and summed up. There is no renormalization scale ambiguity
in this new formula. The spin-dependent potential in the new formula is
expressed in terms of three independent color-electric and color-magnetic field
correlation functions, and it includes both the Eichten-Feinberg's formula and
the one-loop QCD result as special cases.

unbroken and spontaneously broken, as a result of a first order phase
transition. The discrete symmetries of the problem are discussed in general. We
compute the exact two-point Green function for a free fermion, when a thin wall
separates the two phases. The Dirac propagator displays both massive and
massless poles, and new CP-even phases resulting from the fermion reflection on
the wall. We discuss the possible quark-antiquark CP asymmetries produced in
the Standard Model(SM) for the academic $T=0$ case. General arguments indicate
that an effect first appears at order $\alpha_W$ in the reflection amplitude,
as the wall acts as a source of momentum and the on-shell one-loop self-energy
cannot be renormalized away. The asymmetries stem from the interference of the
SM CP-odd couplings and the CP-even phases in the propagator. We perform a toy
computation that indicates the type of GIM cancellations of the problem. The
behaviour can be expressed in terms of two unitarity triangles.

a first order electroweak phase transition. Spatial coherence is lost due to
the quasi-quark damping rate, and we show that reflection on the boundary is
suppressed, even at tree-level. Simply on CP considerations, we argue against
electroweak baryogenesis in the Standard Model via the charge transport
mechanism. A CP asymmetry is produced in the reflection properties of quarks
and antiquarks hitting the phase boundary. An effect is present at order
$\alpha_W^2$ in rate and a regular GIM behaviour is found, which can be
expressed in terms of two unitarity triangles. A crucial role is played by the
damping rate of quasi-particles in a hot plasma, which is a relevant scale
together with $M_W$ and the temperature. The effect is many orders of magnitude
below what observation requires.

An economical notation system is introduced for describing properties of the

approximate but useful relations among the sides and angles of the unitarity
triangles, which can be confronted with the accessible experiments of quark
mixing and $CP$ violation.

poor, we explore various possible ways to test $CPT$ symmetry in $CP$-violating

is difficult to distinguish between the effect of direct $CP$ violation and
that of $CPT$ violation in the time-integrated measurements of neutral $B$
decays to $CP$ eigenstates such as $\psi K_{S}$ and $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$. Instead,
a cleaner signal of small $CPT$ violation may appear in the time-integrated
$CP$ asymmetries for a few non-$CP$-eigenstate channels, e.g.,
$B^{0}_{d}/\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\rightarrow D^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ and
$\stackrel{(-)}{D}$$^{(*)0}K_{S}$. The time-dependent measurements of $CP$
asymmetries are available, in principle, to limit the size of $CPT$-violating
effects in neutral $B$-meson decays.
