  (hyper-abridged)","plain TeX, PhD thesis, UC Berkeley 1993",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The formation of galaxies in hierarchical cosmogonies is studied using high
resolution N-body plus SPH hydrodynamics simulations. The collapse of structure
is followed self-consistently from Mpc scale filamentary structures to kpc
scale galactic objects. The characteristics and formation processes of the
galaxy like objects are studied in detail, along with the aggregation into a
poor cluster. Related studies consider the effects of modelling star formation,
the reliability of tracing galaxies in simulations, and tests of SPH methods.

  All-Sky Galaxy Redshift Surveys","26 pages +5 figures, uuencoded postscript file, submitted to MNRAS,
  CAP-W2",,"10.1093/mnras/272.4.885",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new method for recovering the cosmological density, velocity,
and potential fields from all-sky redshift catalogues. The method is based on
an expansion of the fields in orthogonal radial (Bessel) and angular (spherical
harmonic) functions. In this coordinate system, peculiar velocities introduce a
coupling of the radial harmonics describing the density field in redshift space
but leave the angular modes unaffected. In the harmonic transform space, this
radial coupling is described by a distortion matrix which can be computed
analytically within the context of linear theory; the redshift space harmonics
can then be converted to their real space values by inversion of this matrix.
Statistical noise is mitigated by regularizing the matrix inversion with a
Wiener filter. The method yields a minimum variance estimate of the density
field in real space. In this coordinate system, the minimum variance harmonics
of the peculiar velocity and potential fields are related to those of the
density field by simple linear transformations. Tests of the method with
simulations of a CDM universe and comparison with previously proposed methods
demonstrate it to be a very promising new reconstruction method for the local
density and velocity field. A first application to the 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift
survey is presented.

stochastic tagging. While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic
information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical
and contextual probabilities. In [Brill92], a trainable rule-based tagger was
described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers,
but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple
non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this
rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations
in tagging that are not captured by stochastic taggers. Next, we show a
rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger
can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to
words in some cases of uncertainty.

center surrounded by Gaussian tails can be reproduced with this model.
Dynamical layering (DL), however, only occurs with a very strongly attractive
van der Waals type of substrate potential. To more realistically describe the
spreading of viscous liquid droplets, we introduce a modified SOS model. In the
new model, tendency for DL and the effect of the surface potential are in part
embedded into the dynamics of the model. This allows a relatively simple
description of the spreading under different conditions, with a temperature
like parameter which strongly influences the droplet morphologies. Both rounded
droplet shapes and DL can easily be reproduced with the model. Furthermore, the
precursor width increases proportional to the square root of time, in

by the positions and strengths of electric charges. This suggests a method for
summing over orientable Riemann surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions on
the embedding coordinates. A light-cone parameterization of such boundaries is
also discussed.

proposed and illustrated in several examples. These are based on
``space-times'' which are products of even-dimensional, Riemannian spin
manifolds by a discrete (two-point) set. If the *algebras of operators
describing the non-commutative spaces are generated by functions over such
``space-times'' with values in certain Clifford algebras the Chern-Simons
actions turn out to be the actions of topological gravity on the
even-dimensional spin manifolds. By contrasting the space of field
configurations in these examples in an appropriate manner one is able to
extract dynamical actions from Chern-Simons actions.

compute the Poisson bracket algebra of the supersymmetry and central Noether
charges, and show that the action is invariant under the automorphism group of
this algebra. Surprisingly, for the (4,4) case the automorphism group is always
a subgroup of SO(3), rather than SO(4). We also reanalyse the conditions for
the (2,2) and (4,4) supersymmetry of the zero torsion models without
assumptions about the central charge matrix.

Time, Quantum Physics, Black-Hole dynamics}, and {\em Cosmology}, based on
non-critical string theory, is provided. A new fundamental principle, the {\em
Procrustean Principle}, that catches the essence of our approach is postulated:
the low-energy world is {\em unavoidably} an ``open"" system due to the
spontaneous truncation of the {\em delocalized, topological} string modes in
continuous interaction with the low-lying-{\em localized} string modes. The
origin of space-time, the expansion of the Universe, the entropy increase and
accompanied irreversibility of time, as well as the collapse of the
wavefunction are all very neatly tied together. Possible observable
consequences include: quantum relaxation with time of the Universal,
fundamental constants, like the velocity of light $c$ and the Planck constant
$\hbar$ decreasing towards their asymptotic values, and the cosmological
constant $\Lambda_C$ diminishing towards zero; possible violation of {\em CPT}
invariance in the $K^0-\bar K^0$ system, possible apparent non-conservation of
angular momentum, and possible loss of quantum coherence in SQUID-type
experiments.

apply it to the case of two neutrino flavor or spin precession in the presence
of a noisy matter density or magnetic field, respectively. The criteria under
which physical fluctuations can be well approximated by the delta-correlated
gaussian noise for the above cases are examined. Current limits on the possible
neutrino magnetic moment and solar magnetic field suggest that a reasonably
noisy solar magnetic field would not appreciably affect the solar electron
neutrino flux. However, if the solar electron density has fluctuations of a few
percent of the local density and a small enough correlation length, the MSW
effect is suppressed for a range of parameters.
