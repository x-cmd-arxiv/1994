line between Fanaroff-Riley class~I and class~II Radio Sources is very sharp
when the sources are represented as points in the radio-optical luminosity
plane. It is shown that if one accepts the propositions that the sources in the
vicinity of this dividing line are characterized by (1) transonic Mach numbers
and (2) mildly relativistic velocities (consistent with deceleration of an
initially moderately relativistic or ultrarelativistic jet), then the slope of
the dividing line is readily obtained using simple physical arguments and
established empirical relationships between the X-Ray luminosities, core radii,
velocity dispersions and absolute magnitudes of elliptical galaxies. The
intercept of the dividing line depends upon parameters which are known perhaps
to within factors of order unity and agrees with the data to within an order of
magnitude. ROSAT observations of elliptical galaxies will be important in
constraining the central pressures and X-Ray core radii of radio ellipticals.
Knowledge of these two parameters will assist in a more detailed assessment of
the physics which is proposed here as being relevant. High resolution
observations of jets within a kpc of the radio core will also be useful for
determining the spreading rates of jets in this region.

critical speed $v_c$ of about $0.8\,v_R$, where $v_R$ is the Rayleigh speed.

Newton's constant for the case of pure gravity uncoupled to matter or other
fields. In the general case, the classically irrelevant constant is
proportional to the ratio of the kinetic and potential terms in the
Hamiltonian. It is shown that this ratio can be reinterpreted as an {\it
unconstrained} Hamiltonian, which generates the usual classical equations of
motion. At the quantum level, this immediately suggests a resolution of the
""problem of time"" in quantum gravity. We then make contact with a recently
proposed transfer matrix formulation of quantum gravity and discuss the
semiclassical limit. In this formulation, it is argued that a physical state
can obey a (generalized) Poincar\'e algebra of constraints, and still be an
approximate eigenstate of 3-geometry. Solutions of the quantum evolution

Detectors can be divided into two classes: those most sensitive to spin
dependent incoherent scattering of the ${\tilde {Z}_1}$ (e.g. $CaF_2$) and
those most sensitive to spin independent coherent scattering (high A nuclei
e.g. Pb). The parameter space is studied over the range of $100GeV \leq m_0,

quarkonium production at large transverse momentum in $\bar p p$ and $p p$
collisions. For inclusive $J/\psi$ production, there is a large contribution
from the $g \rightarrow \chi_c$ fragmentation. At large $p_T$, this is
comparable to the conventional charmonium model prediction via gluon fusion at
the ISR and dominates over the latter at the Tevatron energy. This may help to
explain, at least partly, the large $J/\psi$ production cross-section recently
observed by the CDF experiment. However, the fragmentation contribution to
$\psi^{\prime}$ production is not large enough to explain the corresponding CDF
data. We also present the results for $\Upsilon$ production at ISR and Tevatron
energies.

can be organized in a string-like manner to take advantage of this

not at all necessary to achieve the result. The only ingredients required for
the construction are one solution of the symmetry (perturbation) equation and
one constant of the motion of the original system. It turns out that the
Poisson bracket structure for the dynamical variables is far from being
uniquely determined by the differential equations of motion. Examples in
classical mechanics as well as in field theory are presented.

in simplicial quantum gravity. On the lattice we compute correlations between
Wilson lines associated with the heavy particles and which are closed by the
lattice periodicity. We check that the continuum analog of this quantity
reproduces the Newtonian potential in the weak field expansion. In the smooth
anti-de Sitter-like phase, which is the only phase where a sensible lattice
continuum limit can be constructed in this model, we attempt to determine the
shape and mass dependence of the attractive potential close to the critical
point in $G$. It is found that non-linear graviton interactions give rise to a
potential which is Yukawa-like, with a mass parameter that decreases towards
the critical point where the average curvature vanishes. In the vicinity of the
critical point we give an estimate for the effective Newton constant.

canonical transformations to evaluate Hamiltonian path integrals for quantum
mechanical systems. Relevant aspects of the Hamiltonian path integral and its
measure are discussed and used to show that the quantum mechanical version of
the classical transformation does not leave the measure of the path integral
invariant, instead inducing an anomaly. The relation to operator techniques and
ordering problems is discussed, and special attention is paid to incorporation
of the initial and final states of the transition element into the boundary
conditions of the problem. Classical canonical transformations are developed to
render an arbitrary power potential cyclic. The resulting Hamiltonian is
analyzed as a quantum system to show its relation to known quantum mechanical
results. A perturbative argument is used to suppress ordering related terms in
the transformed Hamiltonian in the event that the classical canonical
transformation leads to a nonquadratic cyclic Hamiltonian. The associated
anomalies are analyzed to yield general methods to evaluate the path integral's
prefactor for such systems. The methods are applied to several systems,
including linear and quadratic potentials, the velocity-dependent potential,
and the time-dependent harmonic oscillator.

discussed together with some of its possible signals. Estimates of corrections
to the leading, linear dependence of the quark condensate are found to be
small, implying a significant reduction of that condensate in matter. The
importance of the pion cloud for the scalar quark density of a single nucleon
indicates a close connection between chiral symmetry restoration and the
attractive two-pion exchange interaction between nucleons. This force is
sufficiently long-ranged that nucleons in nuclear matter will feel a
significant degree of symmetry restoration despite the strong correlations
between them. Expected consequences of this include reductions in hadron masses
and decay constants. Various signals of these effects are discussed, in
particular the enhancement of the axial charge of a nucleon in matter.
