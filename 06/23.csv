utilizing only the single best disambiguating evidence in a target context, the
algorithm avoids the problematic complex modeling of statistical dependencies.

of the photocurrent in a superlattice observed by Kwok et al, in an undoped 40
period AlAs/GaAs superlattice. Basic ingredients are an effective negative
differential resistance due to the sequential resonant tunneling of the
photoexcited carriers through the potential barriers, and a rate equation for
the holes that incorporates photogeneration and recombination. The
photoexciting laser acts as a damping factor ending the oscillations when its
power is large enough. The model explains: (i) the known oscillatory static I-V
characteristic curve through the formation of a domain wall connecting high and
low electric field domains, and (ii) the photocurrent and photoluminescence
time-dependent oscillations after the domain wall is formed. In our model, they
arise from the combined motion of the wall and the shift of the values of the
electric field at the domains. Up to a certain value of the photoexcitation,
the non-uniform field profile with two domains turns out to be metastable:
after the photocurrent oscillations have ceased, the field profile slowly
relaxes toward the uniform stationary solution (which is reached on a much
longer time scale). Multiple stability of stationary states and hysteresis are
also found. An interpretation of the oscillations in the photoluminescence
spectrum is also given.

Quantum Gravity can be realized on the state space of extended loop dependent
wavefunctions. The extended representation generalizes the loop representation
and contains this representation as a particular case. The resulting
diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints take a very simple form and allow to
apply functional methods and simplify the loop calculus. In particular we show
that the constraints are linear in the momenta. The nondegenerate solutions
known in the loop representation are also solutions of the constraints in the
new representation. The practical calculation advantages allows to find a new
solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Moreover, the extended representation
puts in a precise framework some of the regularization problems of the loop
representation. We show that the solutions are generalized knot invariants,
smooth in the extended variables, and any framing is unnecessary.

easily lead to a global U(1) symmetry corresponding to exactly conserved
fermion number. The absence of an anomaly in the fermion current would then
appear to inhibit anomalous processes, such as electroweak baryogenesis in the
early universe. One way to circumvent this problem is to formulate the theory
such that this U(1) symmetry is explicitly broken. However we argue that in the
framework of spectral flow, fermion creation and annihilation still in fact
occurs, despite the exact fermion number conservation. The crucial observation
is that fermions are excitations relative to the vacuum, at the surface of the
Dirac sea. The exact global U(1) symmetry prohibits a state from changing its
fermion number during time evolution, however nothing prevents the fermionic
ground state from doing so. We illustrate our reasoning with a model in two
dimensions which has axial-vector couplings, first using a sharp momentum
cutoff, then using the lattice regulator with staggered fermions. The
difference in fermion number between the time evolved state and the ground
state is indeed in agreement with the anomaly. A study of the vacuum energy
shows that the perturbative counterterm needed for restoration of gauge
invariance is insufficient in a nonperturbative setting. For reference we also
study a closely related model with vector couplings, the Schwinger model, and
we examine the emergence of the $\theta$-vacuum structure of both theories.

showing that, as a consequence of non zero densities for conserved charges, the

rate equation for the baryon number generation, we obtain an expression for the
final baryon asymmetry of the Universe containing the relevant parameters of

transport effects were not taken into account, we find an enhancement of nearly

experiment. The properties of the MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem
for different values of $\Phi_B$ are studied. Present data give the bounds:
$0.38 < \Phi_B/ \Phi_B^0 < 3.1$ (2$\sigma$), where $\Phi_B^0 \equiv 5.7 \cdot
10^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ is the flux in the reference SSM. The variations of the
flux in this interval enlarge the allowed region of mixing angles: $\sin^2
2\theta = 8\cdot 10^{-4} \div 2\cdot 10^{-2}$ (small mixing solutions) and
$\sin^2 2\theta = 0.2 \div 0.85$ (large mixing solution). If the value of the
original boron neutrino flux is about that measured by Kamiokande, a consistent
description of the data is achieved for $\sin^2 2\theta \sim (0.8 \div 2)\cdot
10^{-3}$ (``very small mixing solution""). The solution is characterized by a
strong suppression of the beryllium neutrino line, a weak distortion of the
high energy part of the boron neutrino spectrum and a value of the double ratio
$(CC/NC)^{exp}/(CC/NC)^{SSM}$ at $E > 5$ MeV close to 1. We comment on the
possibility to measure the neutrino parameters and the original boron neutrino
flux in future experiments.

tremendously since their independent introduction by Robert V. Moody and Victor
G. Kac in 1968. Inspired by mathematical structures found by theoretical
physicists, and by the desire to understand the ``monstrous moonshine'' of the
Monster group, the theory of vertex operator algebras (VOA's) was introduced by
Borcherds, Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman. An important subject in this young
field is the study of modules for VOA's and intertwining operators between
modules. Feingold, Frenkel and Ries defined a structure, called a vertex
operator para-algebra(VOPA), where a VOA, its modules and their intertwining
operators are unified. In this work, for each $l\geq 1$, we begin with the
bosonic construction (from a Weyl algebra) of four level $-\shf$ irreducible
representations of the symplectic affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra $C_l^{(1)}$. The
direct sum of two of these is given the structure of a VOA, and the direct sum
of the other two is given the structure of a twisted VOA-module. In order to
define intertwining operators so that the whole structure forms a VOPA, it is
necessary to separate the four irreducible modules, taking one As the VOA and
the others as modules for it. This work includes the bosonic analog of the
fermionic construction of a vertex operator superalgebra from the four level 1
irreducible modules of type $D_l^{(1)}$ given by Feingold, Frenkel and Ries.
While they only get a VOPA when $l = 4$ using classical triality, the
techniques in this work apply to any $l\geq 1$.
