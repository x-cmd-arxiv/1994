The invariants have the following applications: (1) to the Van de Ven
conjecture that the Kodaira dimension is a diffeomorphism invariant; (2) to
proving that algebraic surfaces with $p_g > 0$ have a proper sublattice of
$H^2(X,\Z)$ invariant under diffeomorphism; (3) to proving the same result as

A comparison of the dynamical masses from hydrostatic equilibrium with the

four clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshits. It is found that virial
analysis has underestimated the total cluster masses (from lensing) by a factor
of $3\sim6$ within a radius of $\sim0.3$ Mpc $h_{50}^{-1}$ around the cluster

The parsec structure of these 3 objects is very similar: asymmetric emission
which we interpret as the core plus a one-sided jet. The parsec scale jet is
always on the same side of the main kpc-scale jet. The limit on the jet to
counterjet brightness ratio, the ratio of the core radio power to the total
radio power and the Synchrotron-self Compton model allow us to derive some
constraints on the jet velocity and orientation with respect to the line of
sight. From these data and from those published on 2 other sources of our
sample, we suggest that parsec scale jets are relativistic in both FR-I and
FR-II radio galaxies and that pc scale properties in FR-I and FR-II radio
galaxies are very similar despite of the large difference between these two
classes of radio galaxies on the kpc scale.

present Monte-Carlo calculations of the expected optical depth, rates and

a four-component `standard Galaxy' model with a spherically-symmetric halo and
spheroid. Using the typically observed event durations we show that, whilst the
halo fraction comprised of compact matter is likely to be $f_{h} < 0.4$, a `no

confidence level, unless the LMC itself has a substantial halo of such objects.
On the basis of the timescales observed by OGLE towards the bulge we find the
rate predicted by the model to be in good agreement with the number of OGLE
detections. We compute lens mass probability distributions for the various
components and compare these estimates with current observational and
theoretical constraints on the mass scale of baryonic dark matter. We assess
the uniformity of the amplification distributions for the published EROS, MACHO

hypothesis, although the OGLE candidate selection criteria mean that its data
are particularly sensitive to photometric selection effects. The EROS team has
recently placed strong limits on the density contribution of very low mass halo
objects from their short timescale CCD search. On the basis of a recent study
of the flux amplification of finite-size sources by Simmons, Newsam \& Willis

semi-exclusive $^{12}$C$(e,e'p)$ cross section have been calculated in an
unfactorized model for two-nucleon emission. We assume direct two-nucleon
knockout after virtual photon coupling with the two-body pion-exchange currents
in the target nucleus. Results are presented at several kinematical conditions
in the dip and $\Delta$(1232) regions. The calculated two-nucleon knockout
strength is observed to account for a large fraction of the measured $(e,e'p)$
strength above the two-nucleon emission threshold.

governing six-dimensional Einstein equations for the mixmaster space-time
metric pass the ARS or reduced Painlev\'{e} test. We note that this is the case
irrespective of the value, $I$, of the generating Hamiltonian which is a
constant of motion. For $I < 0$ we find numerous closed orbits with two
unstable eigenvalues strongly indicating that there cannot exist two additional
first integrals apart from the Hamiltonian and thus that the system, at least
for this case, is very likely not integrable. In addition, we present numerical
evidence that the average Lyapunov exponent nevertheless vanishes. The model is
thus a very interesting example of a Hamiltonian dynamical system, which is
likely non-integrable yet passes the reduced Painlev\'{e} test.
