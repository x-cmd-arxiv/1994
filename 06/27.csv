distribution as calculated in the weak field limit in an asymptotically flat

demonstrate the surprising result that if the matter is illuminated by a
uniform brightness background that the brightness pattern observed at a given
point in space-time (modulo a term dependent on the oberver's velocity) depends
only on the matter distribution on the observer's past light-cone. These
results apply directly to the cosmological MBR anisotropy pattern generated in
the immediate vicinity of of an object like a cosmic string or global texture.
We apply these results to cosmic strings, finding a correction to previously
published results for in the small-angle approximation. We also derive the
full-sky anisotropy pattern of a collapsing texture knot.

evolution equations. Thus, the outcome of the latter are {\it exact solutions}
for special initial conditions with $H_{ab}=0$, but with no symmetries: they
describe inhomogeneous triaxial dynamics generalizing that of a fluid element
in a Tolman--Bondi, Kantowski--Sachs or Szekeres geometry. A subset of these
solutions may be seen as (special) perturbations of Friedmann models, in the
sense that there are trajectories in phase--space that pass arbitrarily close
to the isotropic ones. We find that the final fate of ever--expanding
configurations is a spherical void, locally corresponding to a Milne universe.
For collapsing configurations we find a whole family of triaxial attractors,
with vanishing local density parameter $\Omega$. These attractors locally
correspond to Kasner vacuum solutions: there is a single physical configuration
collapsing to a degenerate {\it pancake}, while the generic configuration
collapses to a triaxial {\it spindle} singularity. These {\it silent universe}
models may provide a fair representation of the universe on super horizon
scales. Moreover, one might conjecture that the non--local information carried
by $H_{ab}$ becomes negligible during the late highly non--linear stages of
collapse, so that the attractors we find may give all of the relevant expansion
or collapse configurations of irrotational dust.

surface-syntactic analysis of unconstrained English text. It consists of a
summary and three articles. {\it Morphological disambiguation} documents a
grammar for morphological (or part-of-speech) disambiguation of English, done
within the Constraint Grammar framework proposed by Fred Karlsson. The
disambiguator seeks to discard those of the alternative morphological analyses
proposed by the lexical analyser that are contextually illegitimate. The 1,100
constraints express some 23 general, essentially syntactic statements as
restrictions on the linear order of morphological tags. The error rate of the
morphological disambiguator is about ten times smaller than that of another
state-of-the-art probabilistic disambiguator, given that both are allowed to
leave some of the hardest ambiguities unresolved. This accuracy suggests the
viability of the grammar-based approach to natural language parsing, thus also
contributing to the more general debate concerning the viability of
probabilistic vs.\ linguistic techniques. {\it Experiments with heuristics}
addresses the question of how to resolve those ambiguities that survive the
morphological disambiguator. Two approaches are presented and empirically
evaluated: (i) heuristic disambiguation constraints and (ii) techniques for
learning from the fully disambiguated part of the corpus and then applying this
information to resolving remaining ambiguities.

black holes and wormholes in which the metric variables are divided into two

of a spacelike hypersurface into the spacetime, and proper time in the
asymptotically flat regions. All the constraints can be explicitly solved for
the momenta conjugate to the embedding variables. The dynamical variables,
including an extra ADM mass for wormhole topologies, can then be considered as

  Physical Review C","Phys.Rev.C50:1851-1867,1994","10.1103/PhysRevC.50.1851",,"nucl-th",,"  In this paper we address the (charge) longitudinal electromagnetic response
for a homogeneous system of nucleons interacting via meson exchanges in the
functional framework. This approach warrants consistency if the calculation is
carried on order-by-order in the mesonic loop expansion with RPA-dressed
mesonic propagators. At the 1-loop order and considering pion, rho and omega
exchanges we obtain a quenching of the response, in line with the experimental
results.

an emphasis on direct interactions with few degrees of freedom, as an
alternative to the use of local quantum field theories. Several applications
are discussed.
