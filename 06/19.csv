In the strong coupling regime such impurities are pairbreakers, in contrast to
the ordinary Kondo effect. Measurements of $T_c$-suppression may help in
identifying impurities displaying this more exotic exchange coupling to the
conduction band.

Lagrangian for heavy mesons which includes light vector particles. A suitable
notion of vector meson dominance is formulated. The constraints on the heavy
meson -light vector and heavy meson-light pseudoscalar coupling constants are
obtained using experimental $D^* \ra D \, \gamma $ branching ratios. These
constraints are compared with values estimated from semi-leptonic transition
amplitudes as well as from extension of the light meson coupling pattern.
Application to the heavy baryon spectrum in the ``bound state "" model is made.

\phi with a \cos[\beta\phi/2] potential at a boundary. This model has appeared
in several contexts, including tunneling between quantum-Hall edge states and
in dissipative quantum mechanics. For \beta^2 < 8\pi, this system exhibits a
boundary renormalization-group flow from Neumann to Dirichlet boundary
conditions. By taking the massless limit of the sine-Gordon model with boundary
potential, we find the exact S matrix for particles scattering off the
boundary. Using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we calculate the boundary
entropy along the entire flow. We show how these particles correspond to wave
packets in the classical Klein-Gordon equation, thus giving a more precise
explanation of scattering in a massless theory.

negative cosmological constant. This shows a striking contrast to the fact that
the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m-de Sitter black hole with positive cosmological

  Dimensional Quantum Gravity","30 pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  The unified theory of string and two-dimensional quantum gravity is
considered. The action for two-dimensional gravity is choosen in a well-known
induced form and thus gravity posesses it's oun nontrivial dynamics even on the
classical level. Three classically equivalent forms of the action of the
unified theory are described, that is $D$, $D+1$ and $D+2$ formulations where
the last one corresponds to the special kind of nonlinear sigma model on the
background of classical two-dimensional metric. In all cases we find the action
of the theory to be invariant under generalized symmetry transformations, and
point out the arbitrariness of renormalization which reflects this symmetry.
The one - loop counterterms are calculated in a general covariant gauge and
also in conformal gauge. The difference between the counterterms for all
classically equivalent variants of the theory is trivial on mass-shell. Since
the different versions of the theory lead to the one-loop contributions which
coincide on mass shell, the corresponding arbitrariness is related with the
only generalized reparametrizations of the theory. Hence one can formulate the
conditions of Weyl symmetry for any equivalent form of the action. Such a
conditions are written for the $D+2$ formulation and then are reduced to other
ones. The equations for the background interaction fields differ from the ones
in standard approach and look much more complicated.
