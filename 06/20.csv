in various models with long-range interactions is evaluated by means of
Korepin's method\upref vek1/. For models with ${1\over\sin^2(r)}$-interactions
the S-matrix is found to be a momentum-independent phase, which clearly
demonstrates the ideal gas character of the quasiparticles in such models. We
then determine S-matrices for some models with ${1\over\sinh^2(r)}$-interaction
and find them to be in general nontrivial. For the ${1\over r^2}$-limit of the
${1\over\sinh^2(r)}$-interaction we recover trivial S-matrices, thus exhibiting
a crossover from interacting to noninteracting quasiparticles. The relation of
the S-matrix to fractional statistics is discussed.

topological space admits the structure of a Banach analytic space if and only
if it is metrizable with a complete metric.

method. This result is in accordance with theoretical arguments based on the
analysis of the scale dependence of acceptance rates for nonlocal Metropolis
updates. The generalization of the time slice blocking to SU(2) in four
dimensions is investigated analytically and by numerical simulations. Compared
to two dimensions, the local disorder in the four dimensional gauge field leads
to kinematical problems.

non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories. These theories arise naturally as the
low-energy limit of four-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the
heterotic string. Firstly, we define the free energy in the presence of
electric and magnetic fluxes using 't Hooft's prescription, i.e. through
functional integrals at finite volume in the presence of twisted boundary
conditions. Then, we compute those free energies in two limiting cases: small
and large coupling constant. Finally, we extend the free-energies to all values
of the coupling constant (and the theta angle) by presenting a fully S-duality
invariant ansatz. This ansatz obeys all relevant consistency conditions; in
particular, it obeys 't Hooft duality equations and Witten's magnetic-electric
transmutation. The existence of an S-duality invariant, consistent definition
of free energies supports the claim made in the literature that S-duality is a
duality symmetry of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills. Our ansatz also suggests that N=4,
irrespective of whether partially broken or not, is in a self-dual phase: no
phase transitions occur between the strong and weak coupling regimes.

characterized. It is then used to justify the way in which a global curvature
form is defined. Strong connections are interpreted as those that are induced
from the base space of a quantum bundle. Examples of both strong and non-strong
connections are provided. In particular, such connections are constructed on a
quantum deformation of the fibration $S^2 -> RP^2$. A certain class of strong
$U_q(2)$-connections on a trivial quantum principal bundle is shown to be
equivalent to the class of connections on a free module that are compatible
with the q-dependent hermitian metric. A particular form of the Yang-Mills
action on a trivial $U\sb q(2)$-bundle is investigated. It is proved to
coincide with the Yang-Mills action constructed by A.Connes and M.Rieffel.
Furthermore, it is shown that the moduli space of critical points of this
action functional is independent of q.
