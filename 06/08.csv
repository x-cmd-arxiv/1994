22968--14 taken from the survey of Beers, Preston and Shectman (1985, BPS) are
analyzed for abundances. The fine analysis with LTE model atmospheres gives an
iron metallicity for the four stars between $-$3.15 and $-$3.45 in good
agreement with the abundances inferred from CaII K index by Beers et al.
(1992). These four objects considerably augment the number of spectroscopically
studied stars at the low metallicity extreme. We found the $\alpha$-elements
Mg, Ca, Si, and Ti enhanced, and the iron-peak elements Sc, Mn and Cr tracking
closely iron with the typical pattern of the more metallic halo stars. Aluminum
results deficient with respect both to iron and to magnesium showing a strong
{\it odd-even\/} effect, but for [Fe/H] $\leq$ $-$3.0 [Al/Mg] levels out into a
plateau around $-$1.0, showing a primary behaviour. [Na/Fe] is $\approx$ $-$0.2
and only compared to magnesium it shows a mild odd-even effect. The heavy
elements Sr and Ba show a large scatter which is not observed for other
elements and cannot be due to observational errors only. In the case of CS
22891--209 they are particularly overabundant with [Sr,Ba/Fe] $\approx$ 0.9.
The spread might reflect the presence of strong inhomogeneities in the
interstellar gas at the earliest stages of Galaxy formation. This might be an
important signature of the still elusive processes of the early formation of
these elements observed in old stars.

complete sample of nearby Seyferts. Basically, we compare the local galaxy
density distributions of the AGNs with those of non-AGN samples, chosen in

samples. We find, only for the early-type spirals more luminous than $\sim
M^*$, that both LINERs and Seyferts tend to reside in denser environments on
all the scales tested, from tenths of Mpc to a few Mpc; moreover Seyferts show
an enhanced small-scale density segregation with respect to LINERs. This gives
support to the idea that AGNs can be stimulated by interactions. On larger

application-specific text corpora can be used to drive knowledge acquisition at

often very difficult to specify an explicit domain model for many information

successful IE system to a new domain. We will show how ML algorithms can reduce

employing the Feynman path integral. This approach is plagued by some problems:
the integration measure is not uniquely defined, the Einstein-Hilbert action
unbounded, and perturbation theory nonrenormalizable. To make the path integral
tractable one can approximate the continuous geometry of spacetime by a
simplicial complex. The edge lengths of this lattice are considered as the
dynamical degrees of freedom and Regge calculus is applied. In this work,
numerical simulations using the Regge-Einstein action and a ""compact"" action
show the occurence of a phase transition. The strength of this transition,
separating a well-defined phase with finite expectation values from an
ill-defined phase, is weaker for the compact action, which might be important
for the continuum limit. To analyze the interaction mechanism of this
formulation of quantum gravity, correlation functions between geometrical
quantities like edge lengths, volume elements, and local curvatures have been
computed. Our results for the two-point functions seem to prefer exchange
particles with an effective mass. To ease treatment of quantum gravity a new
approach is proposed consisting in a transformation of the path integral to the
partition function of a spin system. This facilitates analytical and numerical
calculations considerably. First results for the phase structure in two as in
four dimensions are presented and indicate promising similarities to the
original Regge theory.

that $\normo{\sum f_k}_p \le C \normo{\sum g_k}_p$, $1 \le p \le \infty$ where
the constant C is independent of p. The aim of this paper is to extend this
result to certain classes of Orlicz and rearrangement invariant spaces. This
paper includes fairly general techniques for obtaining rearrangement invariant
inequalities from Orlicz norm inequalities.

"math/9406216",,"Michel Talagrand","Constructions of Majorizing Measures, Bernoulli processes and cotype",,,,"Banach Archive 6/7/94","math.FA",,"  We present three methods to construct majorizing measures in various
settings. These methods are based on direct constructions of increasing
sequences of partitions through a simple exhaustion procedure rather than on
the construction of well separated ultrametric subspaces. The first scheme of
construction provides a simple unified proof of the Majorizing Measure Theorem
for Gaussian processes and of the following fact. If $A,B$ are balanced convex
sets in a vector space, and if $A$ is sufficiently convex, a control of the
covering numbers $N(A,\varepsilon B)$ for all $\varepsilon>0$ implies the (a
priori stronger) existence of a majorizing measure on $A$ provided with the
distance induced by $B$. This establishes, apparently for the first time, a
clear link between geometry and majorizing measures, and generalizes the
earlier results on majorizing measures on ellipsoids in Hilbert space, that
were obtained by specific methods. Much of the rest of the paper is concerned
with the structure of bounded Bernoulli (=Radmacher) processes. The main
conjecture on their structure is reformulated in several ways, that are shown
to be equivalent, and to be equivalent to the existence of certain majorizing
measures. Two schemes of construction of majorizing measures related to this
problem are presented. One allows to describe Bernoulli processes when the
index set, provided with the supremum norm, is sufficiently small. The other
allows to prove a weak form of the main conjecture.

observed experimentally.
