observations of the rotation and velocity dispersion of its central stellar
disk, are used to infer the presence of a dark matter halo and to measure its
shape. Fits to the observed disk and polar ring rotation curves from detailed
mass and photometric modeling rule out a spherical dark halo. The best fit
models have halos with isodensity surfaces that are flattened to a shape
between E6 and E7 (axis ratios between 0.4 and 0.3); the asymptotic equatorial
speeds of these models are in excellent agreement with the I-band Tully-Fisher
relation. This degree of dark halo flattening is larger than that expected from
N-body collapse simulations of dissipationless dark matter. Since the
kinematics and surface brightness profile of the central luminous body indicate
that its light has an intrinsic axis ratio $c/a \lsim 0.4$, in NGC 4650A the
radial ``conspiracy"" between the dark and luminous components that leads to
flat rotation curves may extend to the {\it shape} of the mass distribution as
well.

only slightly ($\pm$0.005~M$_\odot$) on the interior models. None of the field
brown dwarf candidates in our sample appears to be a very young (age
$<$~10$^8$~yr) substellar object. For one of the faintest proper motion
Pleiades members known (V=20.7) the Li test implies a mass greater than
$\sim$0.08~M$_\odot$, and therefore it is not a brown dwarf. From our spectra
we estimate spectral types for some objects and present measurements of Halpha
emission strengths and radial velocities. Finally, we compare the positions in
the H-R diagram of our sample of brown dwarf candidates with the theoretical
region where Li is expected to be preserved (Substellar Lithium Region). We
find that certain combinations of temperature calibrations and evolutionary

cluster size. Curves for N = 4, 5 and 8 consisted of a smooth, featureless,
monotonic increase throughout the transition region, while curves for N = 7 and

distinguishable transition heat capacity peaks. The size and location of these

finite temperature is considered using the Braaten-Pisarski resummation
technique. First the hard thermal loop diagrams of this theory are extracted
and effective Green's functions are constructed. Using these effective Green's
functions the damping rate of a soft Yukawa fermion is calculated. This rate
provides the most simple example for the damping of a soft particle. To leading
order it is proportional to $g^2T$, whereas the one of a hard fermion is of
higher order.

$\sum_{j=1}^m P_{i_j}^2(x)$ is bounded on the interval $[-b,b]$ ($b>0$). A
complete solution of the problem is presented using duality theory of convex
analysis and the theory of canonical moments. It turns out, that contrary to
many other extremal problems the structure of the solution will depend heavily
on the size of the interval $[-b,b]$.

  June 1994. Presented by NNN at the Workshop on CEBAF at Higher Energies,
  April 14-16 1994",,,,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  CEBAF is a high-luminocity factory of virtual photons with variable
virtuality $Q^{2}$ and transverse size. This makes CEBAF, in particular after
the energy upgrade to (8-12)GeV, an ideal facility for uncovering new
phenomena, and opening new windows, at the interface of the perturbative and
nonperturbative QCD. We discuss color transparency as the case for a broad
program on electroproduction of vector mesons
$\rho^{0},\,\omega^{0},\,\phi^{0}$ and their radial excitations
$\rho',\,\omega',\,\phi'$ at CEBAF. We also comment on the second generation of
experiments on color transparency in $^{4}He(e,e'p)$ scattering, which are also
feasible at CEBAF. In 1994, we can make more reliable projections into future
because our understanding of the onset of color transparency has greatly been
augmented by two experiments completed in 1993:\\ i) no effect of CT was seen
in the SLAC NE18 experiment on $A(e,e'p)$ scattering at virtualities of the
exchanged photon $Q^{2} \lsim 7$ GeV$^{2}$, \\ ii) strong signal of CT was
observed in the FNAL E665 experiment on exclusive $\rho^{0}$- meson production
in deep inelastic scattering in the same range of $Q^{2}$. \\ We discuss the
impact of these observations on the CEBAF experimental program. We argue they
both are good news, both were anticipated theoretically, and both rule in the
correct QCD mechanism of the onset of CT.

and a tensor part. The energy- independent and energy-weighted {\underline
orbital} strength distribution is remarkably insensitive to the presence or
absence of the spin-orbit or tensor interaction -not so the spin strength. The
energy-weighted strength distribution can be divided into a low enegy and a
high energy part. The high energy orbital part is somewhat less but close to
the low energy part, in fair agreement with a prediction that they be equal by
de Guerra and Zamick and by Nojarov. There is a wide plateau separating the low
energy part from the high energy part.
