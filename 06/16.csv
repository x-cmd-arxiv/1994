Natural language. Speech parsing describes the syntactic and semantic analysis

immediate flat analysis, learning of syntactic and semantic speech parsing,
parallel integration of current hypotheses, and the consideration of various
forms of speech related errors. The goal for this approach is to explore the
parallel interactions between various knowledge sources for learning
incremental fault-tolerant speech parsing. This approach is examined in a
system SCREEN using various hybrid connectionist techniques. Hybrid
connectionist techniques are examined because of their promising properties of
inherent fault tolerance, learning, gradedness and parallel constraint
integration. The input for SCREEN is hypotheses about recognized words of a
spoken utterance potentially analyzed by a speech system, the output is
hypotheses about the flat syntactic and semantic analysis of the utterance. In
this paper we focus on the general approach, the overall architecture, and
examples for learning flat syntactic speech parsing. Different from most other
speech language architectures SCREEN emphasizes an interactive rather than an
autonomous position, learning rather than encoding, flat analysis rather than
in-depth analysis, and fault-tolerant processing of phonetic, syntactic and

from the angular parts of the loop integrals. For dimensions less than $d_c=2$
we find a strong--coupling fixed point, which diverges at $d=2$, indicating
that there is non--perturbative strong--coupling behavior for all $d \geq 2$.
At $d=1$ our method yields the identical fixed point as in the one--loop

non--singular. For $d>2$ dimensions, there is no finite strong--coupling fixed

exponent corresponding to the unstable fixed point, which describes the
non--equilibrium roughening transition, to be $z = 2 + {\cal O} (\epsilon^3)$,
in agreement with a recent scaling argument by Doty and Kosterlitz. Similarly,
our result for the correlation length exponent at the transition is $1/\nu =

massive $N_R=1/2$ states of the four-dimensional heterotic string and show the
maximum spin $1$ supermultiplets to correspond to extreme black hole solutions.
The $N_L=1$ states and $N_L>1$ states (with vanishing left-moving internal
momentum) admit a single scalar-Maxwell description with parameters $a=\sqrt 3$
or $a=1$, respectively. The corresponding solitonic magnetically charged
spectrum conjectured by Schwarz and Sen on the basis of $S$-duality is also
described by extreme black holes.

  mechanics","23 pages, LaTeX, CbNU-Th-94-27",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.51.982",,"hep-th",,"  The quantum mechanical version of the four kinds of classical canonical
transformations is investigated by using non-hermitian operator techniques. To
help understand the usefulness of this appoach the eigenvalue problem of a
harmonic oscillator is solved in two different types of canonical
transformations. The quantum form of the classical Hamiton-Jacobi theory is
also employed to solve time dependent Schr\""odinger wave equations, showing
that when one uses the classical action as a generating function of the quantum
canonical transformation of time evolutions of state vectors, the corresponding
propagator can easily be obtained.

can be found for example in Griffiths and Harris it was the goal of these
lectures to introduce some concepts of the modern point of view in algebraic

the whole subject in such a limited time. For this reason the lectures and now
the write-up concentrate on the substitution of the concept of classical points
by the notion of ideals and homomorphisms of algebras.

our previous paper the flagellated motion was analyzed in two dimensional
fluid, by using the method developed in the ciliated motion with the Joukowski
transformation. This method is further refined by incorporating the inertia
term of fluid as the perturbation. Understanding of the algebra controlling the
deformation of microorganisms in the fluid is further developed, obtaining the
central extension of the algebra with the help of the recent progress on the
$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. Our previous suggestion on the usefulness of the
$N$-point string- and membrane-like amplitudes for studying the collective
swimming motion of $N-1$ microorganisms is also examined.

Lagrangian at the Hartree level we find a depression of the condensate with
temperature. For $T < 100$ MeV the results are in good agreement with chiral
perturbation theory in the three loop approximation. Near $T_c$, however, there
are marked differences due to non-perturbative nature of our approach.
