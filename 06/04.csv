modeling approach that can be applied to various tasks including part-of-speech
tagging and building phrase structure trees. The method learns a series of
symbolic transformational rules, which can then be applied in sequence to a
test corpus to produce predictions. The learning process only requires counting
matches for a given set of rule templates, allowing the method to survey a very
large space of possible contextual factors. This paper analyses Brill's
approach as an interesting variation on existing decision tree methods, based
on experiments involving part-of-speech tagging for both English and ancient
Greek corpora. In particular, the analysis throws light on why the new
mechanism seems surprisingly resistant to overtraining. A fast, incremental
implementation and a mechanism for recording the dependencies that underlie the
resulting rule sequence are also described.

from a huge stored database of translation examples is no longer unreasonable.
This paper describes an attempt to merge the Example-Based Machine Translation
(EBMT) approach with psycholinguistic principles. A new formalism for context-
free grammars, called *marker-normal form*, is demonstrated and used to
describe language data in a way compatible with psycholinguistic theories. By
embedding this formalism in a standard multivariate optimization framework, a
system can be built that infers correct transfer functions for a set of
bilingual sentence pairs and then uses those functions to translate novel
sentences. The validity of this line of reasoning has been tested in the
development of a system called METLA-1. This system has been used to infer
English->French and English->Urdu transfer functions from small corpora. The
results of those experiments are examined, both in engineering terms as well as
in more linguistic terms. In general, the results of these experiments were
psycho- logically and linguistically well-grounded while still achieving a
respectable level of success when compared against a similar prototype using
Hidden Markov Models.

We study correlations between changes in the electrical resistivity RHOab(T)

For undoped samples the resistivity is linear in temperature and has a
vanishing residual resistivity. In angle resolved photoemission these samples
show dispersing band-like states. Co-doping decreases TC and causes and
increase in the residual resistivity. Above a threshold Co-concentration the
resistivity is metallic (drab/dT >0) at room temperature, turns insulating
below a characteristic temperature Tmin and becomes super- conducting at even
lower temperature. These changes in the resistivity correlate with the
disappearance of the dispersing band-like states in angle resolved
photoemission. We show that Anderson localization caused by the impurity
potential of the doped Co-atoms provides a consistent explanation of all
experimental features. Therefore the TC reduction in 3d-metal doped high-
temperature superconductors is not caused by Abrikosov Gor'kov pair- breaking
but by spatial localization of the carriers. The observed suppression of TC
indicates that the system is in the homogenous limit of the
superconductor-insulator transition. The coexistance of insulating (dRHOab/dT
<0) normal state behavior and super- conductivity indicates that the
superconducting ground state is formed out of spatially almost localized

shown that the total conductance can be found from an effective Schroedinger

phase leads to Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the total conductance. Neglecting
the contribution of self-crossing resonant-percolation trajectories, one finds
that the inter-edge carrier transport is similar to propagation in

Landau band has an extended state $\bar E_N$, while all other states are
localized. The localization length behaves as $L_N^{-1}(E)\sim (E-\bar E_N)^2$.

"hep-th/9406023","Kelly Davis","Kelly Jay Davis","A-Genus and the Sigma Model","16 Pages",,,,"hep-th",,"  This set of lecture notes presents a pedantic derivation of the connection
between the $ {\hat A} $-genus of spacetime's loop space and the genus one
partition function of the $ N=1/2 $ sigma model. It concludes with some remarks
on possible generalizations of the $ {\hat A} $-genus which follow naturally
from the `stringy' point-of-view but have yet to be explored mathematically.
This set of lecture notes is geared towards a mathematical audience unfamiliar
with the $ N=1/2 $ sigma model.
