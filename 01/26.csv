hybrid annihilation process $q^2\bar q^2 \to q\bar q g \to q^2\bar q^2$ and
conventional $s$-channel $q\bar q$ resonances, in addition to the $t$-channel
gluon exchange treated previously using this formalism. The strength of the
$t$-channel gluon amplitude is fixed by previous studies of $I=2$ $\pi\pi$ and
$I=3/2$ $K\pi$ scattering. The $s$-channel resonances $\rho(770)$, $K^*(892)$,
$f_0(1400)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ are incorporated as relativized Breit-Wigner
amplitudes, with masses and energy-dependent widths fitted to experimental
phase shifts. The strength of the $s$-channel gluon ``hybrid"" annihilation
diagrams is problematical since the perturbative massless-gluon energy
denominator must be modified to account for the effect of confinement on the
energy of the virtual hybrid state. Our naive expectation is that near
threshold the hybrid diagrams are comparable in magnitude but opposite in sign
to the contribution predicted using massless perturbative gluons. Fitting the
strength of this amplitude to $I=0$ $\pi\pi$ and $I=1/2$ $K\pi$ S-wave data
gives a result consistent with this expectation. We find good agreement with
experimental phase shifts from threshold to 0.9 GeV in $\pi\pi$ and 1.6 GeV in
$K\pi$ using this approach. We conclude that the most important contribution to
low energy S-wave scattering in these channels arises from the nonresonant
quark Born diagrams, but that the low-energy wings of the broad $s$-channel
resonances $f_0(1400)$ and $K^*_0(1430)$ also give important contributions near
threshold. The nonresonant contributions are found to be much smaller in $L\;

symmetry breaking occurs by stages at two large intermediate energy scales and
that two large intermediate scales induce large Majorana-masses of right-handed
neutrinos. Peculiar structure of the effective nonrenormalizable interactions
is crucial in the models. In this scheme Majorana-masses possibly amount to
$O(10^{9 \sim 10}\gev)$ and see-saw mechanism is at work for neutrinos. Based
on this scheme we propose a viable model which explains the smallness of masses
for three kind of neutrinos $\nu _e, \nu _{\mu} \ {\rm and}\ \nu _{\tau}$.
Special forms of the nonrenormalizable interactions can be understood as a
consequence of an appropriate discrete symmetry of the compactified manifold.

Bremsstrahlung in Bhabha scattering, e+e- --> e+e-gamma, without constraints on
scattering angles. This allows the study of this process at arbitrarily small,
or even vanishing, scattering angles. Experimental cuts can be imposed on an
event-by-event basis, allowing for detailed studies of the process as a
limitation to beam lifetimes, or a luminosity-measuring device, in e+e- storage
rings. As an application, we show that the easy introduction of a cutoff
parameter, corresponding to the characteristic distance between particles in
the bunches, gives a reduced cross section that is in good agreement with
observation.

connection with the Wilson renormalization group transformation. The fixed
point hamiltonian of our transformation coincides with the static hamiltonian
and irrelevant operators can be identified with the usual $1/M$ corrections to
the static theory. No matching condition has to be imposed between the full and
the static theory operators with our approach. The values of the matching
constants come out as a dynamical effect of the renormalization group flow.

system, the $K\bar{K}$ attraction resulting from the quark-exchange mechanism
gets appreciably decreased compared to that emerging through the naive two-body

identical, and therefore that the two entropies are equal. We comment on the
generality and significance of this result, and make use of it in analyzing the
area and cutoff dependence of the entropy. The equivalence of the density
matrices leads us to speculate that a planar boundary in Minkowski space has a
classical entropy given by the Bekenstein--Hawking formula.

approximately linear in $g$ and $\mu$ constant. We observe that cross--sections
of spin domain boundaries at $T_c$ decompose into a distribution $N(l)$ of
loops of length $l$ that scales as $l^{-\tau}$ with $\tau \sim 2.2$. We address
the prospects for a string--theoretic description of cluster boundaries. (To
