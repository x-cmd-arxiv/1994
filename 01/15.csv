of the art in modelling and prediction of chaotic time series. Sampled data
from deterministic non-linear systems may look stochastic when analysed with
linear methods. However, the deterministic structure may be uncovered and
non-linear models constructed that allow improved prediction. We give the
background for such methods from a geometrical point of view, and briefly
describe the following types of methods: global polynomials, local polynomials,
multi layer perceptrons and semi-local methods including radial basis
functions. Some illustrative examples from known chaotic systems are presented,
emphasising the increase in prediction error with time. We compare some of the
algorithms with respect to prediction accuracy and storage requirements, and
list applications of these methods to real data from widely different areas.

construct a phenomenologically viable class of models in which the three
generations of fermions do not have the same embedding within the fundamental

embeddings of the conventional fermions imply that the left-handed charged
leptons and the right-handed $d$-type quarks are coupled in a non--universal
way to the new neutral gauge bosons $(Z_\theta)$ present in these models. It
was also shown that a unique signature for this scenario, would be a deviation
from unity for the ratio of cross sections for the production of two different
lepton species in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. However, several different scenarios
are possible, depending on the particular assignment chosen for $e_L$, $\mu_L$

of $Z_\theta$ boson. Such scenarios can not be disentangled from one another by
means of cross section measurements alone. In this paper we examine the
possibility of identifying the pattern of embeddings through measurements of
polarized and unpolarized asymmetries for fermion pair-production at the 500

identify the different patterns of unconventional assignments for the

scattering with large three-momentum transfers. Unlike the nonrelativistic
formulation, the relativistic Coulomb sum is restricted to spacelike
four-momenta for the most direct connection with experiments; an immediate
consequence is that excitations involving antinucleons, e.g., $N{\bar N}$ pair
production, are approximately eliminated from the sum rule. Relativistic recoil
and Fermi motion of target nucleons are correctly incorporated. The sum rule
decomposes into one- and two-body parts, with correlation information in the
second. The one-body part requires information on the nucleon momentum
distribution function, which is incorporated by a moment expansion method. The
sum rule given through the second moment (RCSR-II) is tested in the Fermi gas
model, and is shown to be sufficiently accurate for applications to data.

sufficient accuracy to ensure that all the states in the resonance region have
been populated. Many of the resulting peaks are weak enough to become
unobservable. The quenching factor necessary to bring into agreement the low
lying observed states with shell model predictions is shown to be due to
nuclear correlations. To within experimental uncertainties it is the same that
is found in one particle transfer and (e,e') reactions. Perfect consistency
between the observed $^{48}Ca(p,n)^{48}Sc$ peaks and the calculation is
achieved by assuming an observation threshold of 0.75\% of the total strength,
a value that seems typical in several experiments
