gradients are large or when temporal variations are rapid. We derive a modified
set of transport equations that satisfy causality. These equations are obtained
from the underlying Boltzmann equation. We use a simple model for particle
collisions which enables us to derive moment equations non-perturbatively, i.e.
without making the usual assumption that the distribution function deviates
only slightly from its equilibrium value. We apply the model to two problems:
particle diffusion and viscous transport. In both cases we show that signals
propagate at a finite speed and therefore that the formalism obeys causality.
When the velocity gradient is large on the scale of a mean free path, the
viscous shear stress is suppressed relative to the prediction of the standard
diffusion approximation. The shear stress reaches a maximum at a finite value
of the shear amplitude and then decreases as the velocity gradient increases.
In the case of a steady Keplerian accretion disk with hydrodynamic turbulent
viscosity, the stress-limit translates to an upper bound on the Shakura-Sunyaev
$\alpha$-parameter, namely $\alpha<0.07$. The limit on $\alpha$ is much
stronger in narrow boundary layers where the velocity shear is larger than
Keplerian.

systems providing an external circuit and a nonlinear element the model of
which has been developed in [1] (in the development of the model local kinetic
transport coefficients were assumed to be constant), has been analyzed and
simulated. A non-equilibrium phase transition has been shown to be induced by
large-scale hydrodynamic fluctuations (vortex structures). Critical exponents
of the amplitude singular behavior (the order parameters) for three types of
circuits have been determined. Non-equilibrium phase transitions induced by
external harmonic noise with a random or a determined phase have been studied.
The detuning between an external noise frequency and natural frequencies of a
nonlinear element determined by large-scale hydrodynamic fluctuations have been
shown to give rise to random oscillations, which are typical of a strange
attractor. When the frequencies coincide, a limit cycle appears in the system,
which is characterized by the fact that the phase trajectory does not fill the
phase space completely.

dependent metric is introduced which non-linearly realizes the gauge fields on
the non-compact group $SL(2,C)$, while linearly realizing them on $SU(2)$.
Einstein's $SL(2,C)$ invariant theory of gravity emerges at low energies, since
the extra degrees of freedom associated with the quadratic curvature and the
internal metric only dominate at high energies. In a fixed internal metric
gauge, only the the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is satisfied, the particle spectrum
is identified and the Hamiltonian is shown to be bounded from below. Although
Lorentz invariance is broken in this gauge, it is satisfied in general. The
theory is quantized in this fixed, broken symmetry gauge as an $SU(2)$ gauge
theory on a lattice with a lattice spacing equal to the Planck length. This
produces a unitary and finite theory of quantum gravity.

configurations, and numerical simulations can be efficiently implemented by
means of look-up tables. In three dimensions we find a peak in the ``curvature
susceptibility'' which grows with increasing system size. However, the value of
the corresponding critical exponent as well as the behavior of the curvature at
the transition differ from that found by Hamber and Williams for the Regge
theory with continuously varying link lengths.
