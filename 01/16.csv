  Enhancement","32 pages, RevTeX 3.0, figures on request",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.50.10578",,"cond-mat",,"  Orbital Kondo effect is treated in a model, where additional to the
conduction band there are localized orbitals close to the Fermi energy. If the
hopping between the conduction band and the localized heavy orbitals depends on
the occupation of the atomic orbitals in the conduction band then orbital Kondo
correlation occurs. The noncommutative nature of the coupling required for the
Kondo effect is formally due to the form factors associated with the assisted
hopping which in the momentum representation depends on the momenta of the
conduction electrons involved. The leading logarithmic vertex corrections are
due to the local Coulomb interaction between the electrons on the heavy orbital
and in the conduction band. The renormalized vertex functions are obtained as a
solution of a closed set of differential equations and they show power
behavior. The amplitude of large renormalization is determined by an infrared
cutoff due to finite energy and dispersion of the heavy particles. The enhanced
assisted hopping rate results in mass enhancement and attractive interaction in
the conduction band. The superconductivity transition temperature calculated is
largest for intermediate mass enhancement, $m^*/m \approx 2-3$. For larger mass
enhancement the small one particle weight ($Z$) in the Green's function reduces
the transition temperature which may be characteristic for other

in the limit of infinite black hole mass. The problem is addressed from the
point of view of both canonical quantum gravity and superstring theory. The
entropy per unit area of a free scalar field propagating in a fixed black hole
background is shown to be quadratically divergent near the horizon. It is shown
that such quantum corrections to the entropy per unit area are equivalent to
the quantum corrections to the gravitational coupling. Unlike field theory,
superstring theory provides a set of identifiable configurations which give
rise to the classical contribution to the entropy per unit area. These
configurations can be understood as open superstrings with both ends attached
to the horizon. The entropy per unit area is shown to be finite to all orders
in superstring perturbation theory. The importance of these conclusions to the
resolution of the problem of black hole information loss is reiterated.
