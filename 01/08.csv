potential for a general class of inflationary models. (1) We first consider the
reconstruction of the inflationary potential for given primordial density
fluctuation spectra. Our work differs from previous work on reconstruction in
that we find a semi-analytic solution for the potential for the case of density
fluctuations with power-law spectra. In addition, for the case of more general
spectra, we show how constraints on the density fluctuation spectra imply
corresponding constraints on the potential. We present a series of figures
which show how the shape of the potential depends on the shape of the
perturbation spectrum and on the relative contribution of tensor modes. (2) We
show that the average ratio $\rave$ of the amplitude of tensor perturbations
(gravity wave perturbations) to scalar density perturbations is bounded from
above: $\rave \le$ 1.6. We also show that the ratio $\rave$ is proportional to
the change $\Delta \phi$ in the field: $\rave \approx 0.42 \Delta \phi/\mp$.
Thus, if tensor perturbations are important for the formation of structure,
then the width $\Delta \phi$ must be comparable to the Planck mass. (3) We
constrain the change $\Delta V$ of the potential and the change $\Delta \phi$
of the inflation field during the portion of inflation when cosmological
structure is produced. We find both upper and lower bounds for $\Delta \phi$
and for $\Delta V$. In addition, these constraints are then used to derive a
bound on the scale $\Lambda$, which is the scale of the height of the potential

relating the two gauges. We then write down in parallel in both gauges the
coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and fluid equations that govern the
evolution of the metric perturbations and the density fluctuations of the
particle species. The particle species considered include cold dark matter
(CDM), baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (a hot dark
matter or HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryon components are treated as
fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and
neutrinos. The linear evolution equations presented are applicable to any
$\Omega=1$ model with CDM or a mixture of CDM and HDM. Isentropic initial
conditions on super-horizon scales are derived. The equations are solved
numerically in both gauges for a CDM+HDM model with $\Omega_{\rm cold}=0.65,$
$\Omega_{\rm hot}=0.3$, and $\Omega_{\rm baryon}=0.05$. We discuss the
evolution of the metric and the density perturbations and compare their
different behaviors outside the horizon in the two gauges. In a companion paper
we integrate the geodesic equations for the neutrino particles in the perturbed
conformal Newtonian background metric computed here. The purpose is to obtain
an accurate sampling of the neutrino phase space for the HDM initial conditions
in $N$-body simulations of the CDM+HDM models.

  text from BM",,"10.1093/mnras/270.2.209",,"astro-ph",,"  SHORTENED ABSTRACT: We present numerical investigations designed to
critically test models of the origin of the Magellanic Stream. The most
developed model is the tidal model which fails to reproduce several of its
characteristic properties. We suggest an alternative model for the origin of
the Stream which can explain all of its observed features and dynamics, as well
as provide a strong constraint on the distribution of gas within the halo of
the Milky Way. We propose that the Stream consists of material which was
ram-pressure stripped from the Magellanic System during its last passage
through an extended ionized disk of the Galaxy. This collision took place some
500 million years ago at a galacto-centric distance of about 65 kpc, and swept
$\sim 20$\% of the least bound HI into the Stream. The gas with the lowest
column density lost the most orbital angular momentum, and is presently at the
tip of the Stream, having fallen to a distance of $\sim 20$ kpc from the Milky
Way attaining a negative velocity of 200 \kms. To prevent the stripped material
from leading the Magellanic Clouds and attaining too large an infall velocity,
we postulate the existence of an extended dilute halo of diffuse ionized gas
surrounding the Milky Way. If the halo gas is at the virial temperature of the
potential well of the Milky Way, its thermal emission would contribute $\sim$
40\% of the observed diffuse background radiation in the 0.5-1.0 keV (M) band,
consistent with recent ROSAT measurements as well as pulsar dispersion
measures. Ram pressure stripping

  from X-ray Absorption Fine Structure","20 pages plus 7 ps figures, REVTEX 3.0",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.49.3432",,"cond-mat",,"  We present K-edge XAFS (X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure) data for various
concentrations of Pr in Y$_{1- x}$Pr$_{x}$Ba$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$. The
character of the Pr K-edge XAFS data indicate that most of the Pr substitutes
onto the Y site and is well ordered with respect to the unit cell. These data
also show that the amplitude of the first Pr-O peak is greatly reduced when
compared to the first Y-O peak in pure YBCO, and decreases with increasing Pr
concentration. In contrast, the Y K-edge data for these alloys show little if
any change in the oxygen environment, while the Cu K-edge data show a 10\%
reduction in the first Cu-O peak. Fits to the Pr data suggest that some oxygen
atoms about the Pr become disordered and/or distorted; most of the Pr-O
nearest- neighbor distances are 2.45 \AA, but about 15-40\% of them are in a
possibly broadened peak at 2.27$^{+0.03}_{-0.12}$ \AA. The Cu K-edge XAFS data
show a slight broadening but no loss of oxygens, which is consistent with a
radial distortion of the Pr-O bond. The existence and the size of these two
bond lengths is consistent with a mixture of Pr$^{3+}$ and Pr$^{4+}$ bonds, and
to a formal valence of +3.33$^{+0.07}_{-0.18}$ for the Pr ion. This paper
should be published in Feb. 1994 in Phys. Rev. B.
