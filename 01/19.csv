rotation-powered pulsars based on the Outer Gap model of Cheng, Ho \&~Ruderman
(1986a,b). We have improved upon previous efforts to model the spectra from
these pulsars (e. g. Cheng, et al. 1986b; Ho 1989) by following the variation
in particle production and radiation properties with position in the outer gap.
Curvature, synchrotron and inverse-Compton scattering fluxes vary significantly
over the gap and their interactions {\it via} photon-photon pair production
build up the radiating charge populations at varying rates. We have also
incorporated an approximate treatment of the transport of particle and photon
fluxes between gap emission zones. These effects, along with improved
computations of the particle and photon distributions, provide very important
modifications of the model gamma-ray flux. In particular, we attempt to make
specific predictions of pulse profile shapes and spectral variations as a
function of pulse phase and suggest further extensions to the model which may
provide accurate computations of the observed high energy emissions.

and its Fourier transform generated by the gravitational tidal forces of the
inflationary de Sitter expansion are derived for a massless or light ($m<<H$)
neutral scalar field $\Phi$ without self--interactions, minimally coupled to
gravity. The field has no classical background component, $<\Phi>=0$. Every
observationally relevant mode (which has today $\lambda_{phys}<H_0^{-1}$) had
at early times $R/k_{phys}^2\to0$, and is taken to be initially in the
Minkowski vacuum state. Our computation of $C(x,y)$, which involves four field
operators, is finite and unambiguous at each step, since we use the following
two tools: (1) We use a normal ordered energy density operator N$[\rho]$ and
show that any normal ordering N gives the same finite result. (2) Since
$C(x,y)$ has the universal $|x-y|^{-8}$ short--distance behaviour, the Fourier
transform can only be performed after smearing the energy density operator in
space and time with a smearing scale $\tau$. The resulting energy density
fluctuations are non--Gaussian, but obey a $\chi^2$--distribution. The power
spectrum $\dk$ involves a smearing scale $\tau$, and we choose $\tau=k^{-1}$.
For massless scalars we obtain $k^3\dk\sim H^4k^4$ on super--horizon scales
$k<H$. For light scalars with masses $m\ll H$ a plateau appears on the largest
scales $k<\sqrt{m^3/H}$, the result is $k^3\dk\sim m^6H^2(k/H)^{4m^2/3H^2}$. On
sub--horizon scales $k>H$ we have the universal law $k^3\dk\sim k^8$.

Gross-Neveu model, $O(N)$ and $CP^{N-1}$-like models using a formalism based on
the introduction of bilocal fields that permits to perform easily the large-N
expansion of this set of models in a unified and general way. We mainly discuss
the $SU(N)$ gauge field theory minimally coupled to fermionic plus bosonic
matter in the fundamental representation, and we obtain within the path
integral approach exact equations for the particle spectrum, also in presence
of renormalizable polynomial potentials. Finally, we discuss the correspondence
between this new approach and the one previously used in the context of the
$O(N)$ vector models.

It is shown, that by consistent quantization within the framework of collective
coordinates these relations ensure the correct diagonal expressions for the
kinetic and centrifugal terms in the Hamiltonian in the lowest orders of the
perturbation expansion. The connection between these properties and virial
relations is also determined.

nucleon. The formalism of such reactions is presented including polarization
degrees of freedom and theoretical approaches are discussed. In particular, the
threshold and $\Delta$-resonance region of pion photoproduction is considered
and recent developments on low energy theorems (LET) and the E2/C2 quadrupole
excitation of the $\Delta$ are presented. For eta photoproduction we show our
calculations for the threshold region of the new Mainz experiment and
demonstrate the sensitivity of this reaction to the elementary $\eta NN$
coupling and the resonance parameters of the $S_{11}(1535)$. In nuclear
applications we point out the importance and advantage of light nuclei as $d$,
$^3H$, $^3He$ and $^4He$ for the isospin structure of the reactions as well as
for medium effects of the nucleon resonances.
