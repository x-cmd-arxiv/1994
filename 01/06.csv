of the possible detection range ($ < 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$) a fraction of the
lens detection events should involve the lens crossing directly in front of the
disk of the background star. Previously, Nemiroff (1987) has shown that each
crossing would create an inflection point in the light curve of the MACHO
event. Such inflection points would allow a measure of the time it took for the
gravitational lens to cross the stellar disk. Given an independent estimate of
the stellar radius by other methods, one could then obtain a more accurate
estimate of the velocity of the lens. This velocity could then, in turn, be
used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the mass range for the MACHO or disk
star doing the lensing.

Moreover, the possibility of hot spots formation in a liquid metal (in the

the local kinetic transport coefficients - constant) has been shown. The latter
is of great interest for understanding the mechanism of initiation and

continium and tight-binding models of independent electrons. The calculation is
performed with disorder and also at finite temperature. In the absence of
disorder and at zero temperature agreement is obtained with earlier results by
D. Loss et. al., in that there is half quantum flux periodicity for a large and
odd number of electrons, but full quantum periodicity for any even number of
electrons in the ring. Strong, disorder converts the period into full quantum
periodicity. Finite temperature reduces the magnitude of the current, but
preserves the quantum flux periodicity at zero temperature. However the sign of
the current may change as disorder or temperature is increased. A
generalization of the parity effect, previously discussed by Legett, Loss and
Kusmartsev is described for the case where there are electrons with spin,
influenced by finite temperature and disorder.

reduced to the result $\alpha_c=\pi/3$ of the Schwinger-Dyson equation in the
