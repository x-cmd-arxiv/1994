forest systems with strong lines. We have performed a similar search for C IV
in our 10 km/sec echelle spectra of the bright QSO HS~1946+7658. We shifted the
spectra to align the expected positions of the C IV lines in 65 Lyman-alpha
systems, then added them. The resulting composite spectrum, equivalent to 390
hours of exposure time on the Lick 3-m telescope, has a signal-to-noise ratio
of 80 per 0.025 Angstrom in the rest frame of the absorbers. We do not see any
C IV lines down to a $2\sigma$ limit of W$(1548) \leq 1.4 $~m\AA, about
one-fifth of the strength of the lines seen by Lu. The C IV lines which Lu saw
must be restricted to rare Lyman-alpha systems with large H I column densities
$\geq 10^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$, which are too rare to show C IV in our sample. More
common Lyman-alpha systems with H I column densities of $10^{13}$ --
$10^{14}$~cm$^{-2}$ do not show C IV lines. If their ionization is H/H~I $=
10^4$ then they have [C/H] $\leq -2.0$.

and quantum fluctuations. We compute the amplitude of the perturbations
generated by those quantum fluctuations in JBD theory with an arbitrary
potential for the inflaton field. The effect of the quantum fluctuations on the
background fields is equivalent to a Brownian motion of the scalar fields,
which can be described with the use of a Fokker--Planck diffusion equation. The
probability to find a given value of the fields in the comoving frame can be
written as a Gaussian distribution centered on their classical trajectory, with
decreasing dispersion along both field directions. We also calculate the
condition for the Universe to enter a self-regenerating inflationary phase. The
probability distribution in the physical frame, which takes into account the
expansion of the proper volume of the inflationary domains, will be
concentrated at the Planck boundary and will move along it towards large values
of the fields.

interaction method. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The broad peaks at
excitation energies, 3.7eV, 4.7eV, and 5.7eV, observed in experiments of C60
molecules in a solution are reasonably described by the present theory. Peak
positions and relative oscillator strengths are in overall agreement with the

by the bond disorder model. (2) The optical gap of C70 is larger when the
electric field of light is parallel to the long axis of the molecule. The shape
of the frequency dispersion also depends on the orientation of the molecule.
These properties are common in the free electron model and the model with
Coulomb interactions. (3) The spectrum of C70 averaged over bond disorder and
random orientations is compared with experiments in a solution. There is an
overall agreement about the spectral shape. Differences in the spectra of C60

technicolor. We review the classical theory of technicolor, based on naive
scaling from quantum chromodynamics, and discuss the classical theory's fatal
flaws. Finally, we describe the principal attempt to correct these flaws, the
theory of walking technicolor.

theory is being developed in a series of papers including hep-th 9309076 and

operator algebra for which products of intertwining operators are known to be
convergent in the appropriate regions, including the vertex operator algebras
associated with the WZNW models, the minimal models and the moonshine module
for the Monster. In this paper, we provide background and motivation; we
present the main constructions and properties of the tensor product operation
associated with a particular element of a suitable moduli space of spheres with
punctures and local coordinates; we introduce the notion of ``vertex tensor
category,'' analogous to the notion of tensor category but based on this moduli
space; and we announce the results that the category of modules for a vertex
operator algebra of the type mentioned above admits a natural vertex tensor
category structure, and also that any vertex tensor category naturally produces
a braided tensor category structure.

between certain matter-gravity systems and matrix models. We also show that
much, probably all, of this can be generalized to $W$-gravity, and this leads
to an infinite class of new exactly solvable systems. These systems are
governed by certain integrable hierarchies, which are generalizations of the
usual KdV hierarchy and whose algebraic structure is given in terms of quantum

responsible for an unusual physics. There is a stable vacuum state in which the
vacuum energy is zero, correlation functions are numbers thus the model is in
the topological phase. However, there are other vacuum states in which
correlation functions show the coordinate dependence. The estimation of the
vacuum energy indicates that it is nonzero. These states are interpreted as the

This new amplitude provides a superior description of $pp\gamma$ data. The
predictions of this new amplitude are in close agreement with potential-model
calculations, which implies that, contrary to conclusions drawn by others,
off-shell effects are essentially insignificant below pion-production
threshold.

can arise in pattern-forming systems with a neutral curve that has a double
minimum. Within the framework of the phase equation, the interaction of such
walls is purely attractive. Thus, they annihilate each other and, if the total
phase is not conserved, the final state will be periodic with a single wave
number. Here we study the stability of arrays of domain walls (domain
structures) in a fourth-order Ginzburg-Landau equation. We find a discrete set
of domain structures which differ in the quantized lengths of the domains. They
are stable even without phase conservation, as, for instance, in the presence
of a subcritical ramp in the control parameter. We attribute this to the
spatially oscillatory behavior of the wave number which should lead to an
oscillatory interaction between the domain walls. These results are expected to
shed also some light on the stability of two-dimensional zig-zag structures.

First, we present the results of a numerical simulation program which are not
compatible with the existence of a radiative threshold, predicted by earlier
calculations. Second, we carry out a perturbative calculation which helps
interpret those previous predictions, enabling us to understand in depth our
numerical results. Third, we apply the collective coordinate formalism to this
system and demonstrate numerically that it accurately reproduces the observed
kink dynamics. Fourth, we report on a novel occurrence of length scale
competition in this system and show how it can be understood by means of linear
stability analysis. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the general physical
framework that arises from our study.
