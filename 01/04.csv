examined for various temperatures which the star may realistically encounter
during its lifetime. It is found that for a bag constant less than a critical
value, a very large part of the star will be converted into the quark phase
within a fraction of a second. Depending on the equation of state for neutron
star matter and strange quark matter, all or some of the outer parts of the
star may subsequently be converted by a slower burning or a detonation.

in a matter dominated universe is determined by $\Omega$, and the optical depth
to the surface of last scattering. In particular, the location of the primary
Doppler peak depends primarily on $\Omega$ and is fairly insensitive to the
other unknown parameters, such as $\Omega_b$, $h$, $\Lambda$, and the shape of
the power spectrum. Therefore, measurements of CMB anisotropies on small scales
may be used to determine $\Omega$.

the current. Our approach allows the study of charge transfer without breaking
the circuit. We analyze a single channel conductor and derive electron counting
statistics for arbitrary relation between temperature and voltage. For a
perfectly transmitting channel the counting distribution is gaussian, both for
zero-point fluctuations and at finite temperature. At constant voltage and low
temperature the distribution is binomial, i.e., it arises from Bernoulli
