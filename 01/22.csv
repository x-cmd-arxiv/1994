It is demonstrated that the direction of the current is opposite when the power

from lattice calculations are employed. By solving the Boltzmann equation for

left the problem of the quantization of the magical realizations open. In later
work, Mohammedi showed that the first two magical realizations did not survive
quantization. In this note we close the problem by showing that neither do the
