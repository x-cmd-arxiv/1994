eras of substantial entropy generation in the universe can be described in the
scheme of the KPZ equation. Therefore, the influence on cosmological structure
formation by stochastic forces arising from various dissipations can be studied
through the universal characteristics of surface growth in $d=3+1$ dimensions.
We identify eras of strong stochastic fluctuations and describe dynamically how
these other dissipative sources of noise, besides initial (inflationary)
quantum fluctuations, generate seeds of density perturbation with power law
spectrum, including the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum.

measuring the average difference in energy between the neutrino line produced

neutrino line produced in a terrestrial laboratory. This energy shift is
calculated to be 1.29~keV (to an accuracy of a few percent) for the dominant
ground-state to ground-state transition. The energy shift is approximately
equal to the average temperature of the solar core, computed by integrating the
temperature over the solar interior with a weighting factor equal to the
locally-produced $^7$Be neutrino emission. The characteristic modulation of the
${\rm ^7Be}$ line shape that would be caused by either vacuum neutrino
oscillations or by matter-enhanced (MSW) neutrino oscillations is shown to be
small. Other frequently-discussed weak interaction solutions to the solar

central temperature distribution of the sun.

  The model allows exact quantum solution through algebraic Bethe ansatz and
also a straightforward and natural generalisation to the vector case, giving
thus a new exact lattice version of the vector NLS model. A deformation
representing a new quantum integrable system involving Tamm-Dancoff like
$q$-boson operators is constructed.

couplings of the dilaton may provide a mechanism for fixing the vacuum
expectation value of a massless dilaton in a way which is naturally compatible
with existing experimental data. Under a certain assumption of universality of
the dilaton coupling functions , the cosmological evolution of the
graviton-dilaton-matter system is shown to drive the dilaton towards values
where it decouples from matter (``Least Coupling Principle""). Quantitative
estimates are given of the residual strength, at the present cosmological
epoch, of the coupling to matter of the dilaton. The existence of a weakly
coupled massless dilaton entails a large spectrum of small, but non-zero,
observable deviations from general relativity. In particular, our results
provide a new motivation for trying to improve by several orders of magnitude
the various experimental tests of Einstein's Equivalence Principle
(universality of free fall, constancy of the constants,\dots).

a consequence nonvanishing $3p3h$ effects to the $1p1h$ response involve off

Boussinesq approximation, which includes as two special cases, one equation
discussed by Ablowitz et. al. [Stud. Appl. Math., 53 (1974) 249--315] and one
by Hirota and Satsuma [J. Phys. Soc. Japan}, 40 (1976) 611--612]. A catalogue
of classical and nonclassical symmetry reductions, and a Painleve analysis, are
given. Of particular interest are families of solutions found containing a rich
variety of qualitative behaviours. Indeed we exhibit and plot a wide variety of
solutions all of which look like a two-soliton for t>0 but differ radically for
t<0. These families arise as nonclassical symmetry reduction solutions and
solutions found using the singular manifold method. This example shows that
nonclassical symmetries and the singular manifold method do not, in general,
yield the same solution set. We also obtain symmetry reductions of the shallow
water equation solvable in terms of solutions of the first, third and fifth
Painleve equations. We give evidence that the variety of solutions found which
exhibit ``nonlinear superposition'' is not an artefact of the equation being
linearisable since the equation is solvable by inverse scattering. These
solutions have important implications with regard to the numerical analysis for
the shallow water equation we study, which would not be able to distinguish the
solutions in an initial value problem since an exponentially small change in
the initial conditions can result in completely different qualitative
behaviours.

solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. This allows us to give the general
integrable evolution corresponding to an arbitrary time and space dependence of
the spectral transform (in general nonlinear and with non-analytic dispersion
relations). The main theorem is that the compatibility conditions gives always
a true nonlinear evolution because it can always be written as an identity
between polynomials in the spectral variable $k$. This general result is then
used to obtain first a method to generate a new class of solutions to the
nonlinear Schroedinger equation, and second to construct the spectral transform
theory for solving initial-boundary value problems for resonant wave-coupling
processes (like self-induced transparency in two-level media, or stimulated
Brillouin scattering of plasma waves or else stimulated Raman scattering in
nonlinear optics etc...).
