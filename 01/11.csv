field (the inflaton) rolls while the other is trapped in a false vacuum state.
The false vacuum becomes unstable when the inflaton field falls below some
critical value, and a first or second order transition to the true vacuum
ensues. Particular attention is paid to Linde's second-order `Hybrid
Inflation'; with the false vacuum dominating, inflation differs from the usual
true vacuum case both in its cosmology and in its relation to particle physics.
The spectral index of the adiabatic density perturbation can be very close to
1, or it can be around ten percent higher. The energy scale at the end of
inflation can be anywhere between $10^{16}$\,GeV and $10^{11}$\,GeV, though
reheating is prompt so the reheat temperature can't be far below
$10^{11}\,$GeV. Topological defects are almost inevitably produced at the end
of inflation, and if the inflationary energy scale is near its upper limit they
can have significant effects.
  Because false vacuum inflation occurs with the inflaton field far below the
Planck scale, it is easier to implement in the context of supergravity than
standard chaotic inflation. That the inflaton mass is small compared with the
inflationary Hubble parameter is still a problem for generic supergravity
theories, but remarkably this can be avoided in a natural way for a class of
supergravity models which follow from orbifold compactification of
superstrings. This opens up the prospect of a truly realistic, superstring

couplings such as $Y$--$e$--$e$ that change lepton family number by two units,
dileptons may also have family non-diagonal couplings such as $Y$--$\mu$--$e$.
The latter coupling violates lepton family number by a single unit and
manifests itself via lepton flavor changing decays such as $\mu\to3e$ and
$\mu\to e\gamma$. The family non-diagonal interaction can be CP violating and
typically generates extremely large leptonic electric dipole moments. We
demonstrate a natural mechanism for eliminating both single unit lepton flavor
violation and large leptonic CP violation. Although we focus on the 331 model,
our results are applicable to other dilepton models as well, including $SU(15)$

points of the potential along with the gradient flow curves joining these

that the static potential is actually negligible in comparison to this

which imply that a space of small character has large weight. In section 3 we
construct a ZFC example of a first countable 0-dimensional space X of size
2^omega with w(X)=2^omega and nw(X)=omega, we show that CH implies the
existence of a 0-dimensional space Y of size omega_1 with w(Y)=nw(Y)=omega_1
and chi(Y)=R(Y)=omega, and we prove that it is consistent that 2^omega is as
large as you wish and there is a 0-dimensional space Z of size 2^omega such
that w(Z)=nw(Z)=2^omega but chi(Z)=R(Z^omega)=omega.

  presented at the XIVth European Conference of Few-Body Problems in Physics,
  Amsterdam, August 23-28, 1993","Few Body Syst.Suppl. 7 (1994) 1-12",,"THEF-NYM-93.15","nucl-th",,"  After a short survey of some topics of interest in the study of baryon-baryon
scattering, the recent Nijmegen energy dependent partial wave analysis (PWA) of
the nucleon-nucleon data is reviewed. In this PWA the energy range for both pp
and np is now 0 < Tlab < 350 MeV and a chi^2_{d.o.f.}=1.08 was reached. The
implications for the pion-nucleon coupling constants are discussed. Comments
are made with respect to recent discussions around this coupling constant in
the literature. In the second part, we briefly sketch the picture of the baryon
in several, more or less QCD-based, quark-models that have been rather
prominent in the literature. Inspired by these pictures we constructed a new
soft-core model for the nucleon-nucleon interaction and present the first
results of this model in a chi^2 -fit to the new multi-energy Nijmegen PWA.
With this new model we succeeded in narrowing the gap between theory and
experiment at low energies. For the energies Tlab = 25-320 MeV we reached a
record low chi^2_{p.d.p.} = 1.16. We finish the paper with some conclusions and
an outlook describing the extension of the new model to baryon-baryon
scattering.
