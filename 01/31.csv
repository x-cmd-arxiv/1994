  ""Anticanonical boundedness for curves""","62 pages, AMS-TEX, version 2,1",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We prove the general diagram method theorem valid for the quite large class
of 3-folds with Q-factorial singularities (see Basic Theorem 1.3.2 and also
Theorem 2.2.6). This gives the generalization of our results about Fano 3-folds
with Q-factorial terminal singularities (Preprint alg-geom/9311007).
  As an application, we get the following result about 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau
manifolds X: Assume that the Picard number \rho (X) > 93. Then one of two cases
(i) or (ii) holds:
  (i) there exists a small extremal ray on X;
  (ii) There exists a nef element h such that h^3=0 (thus, the nef cone NEF(X)
and the cubic intersection hypersurface W_X have a common point; here, we don't
claim that h is rational!).
  As a corollary, we get: Let X be a 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. Assume
that the nef cone NEF(X) is finite polyhedral and X does not have a small
extremal ray. Then there exists a rational nef element h with h^3=0 if
\rho(X)>93.
  To prove these results about Calabi-Yau manifolds, we also use one result of
V.V. Shokurov on the length of divisorial extremal rays (see Appendix by V.V.
Shokurov). Thus, one should consider the results on Calabi-Yau 3-folds above as
our common results with V.V. Shokurov.
  We also discuss generalization of results above to so called Q-factorial
models of Calabi-Yau 3-folds, which sometimes permits to involve non-polyhedral
case and small extremal rays to the game.

many cases the performance of the nervous system is so good that it apporaches
fundamental physical limits, such as the limits imposed by diffraction and
photon shot noise in vision. In this paper we show how to use the language of
statistical field theory to address and solve problems in signal processing,
that is problems in which one must estimate some aspect of the environment from
the data in an array of sensors. In the field theory formulation the optimal
estimator can be written as an expectation value in an ensemble where the input
data act as external field. Problems at low signal-to-noise ratio can be solved
in perturbation theory, while high signal-to-noise ratios are treated with a
saddle-point approximation. These ideas are illustrated in detail by an example
of visual motion estimation which is chosen to model a problem solved by the
fly's brain. In this problem the optimal estimator has a rich structure,
adapting to various parameters of the environment such as the mean-square
contrast and the correlation time of contrast fluctuations. This structure is
in qualitative accord with existing measurements on motion sensitive neurons in
the fly's brain, and we argue that the adaptive properties of the optimal
estimator may help resolve conlficts among different interpretations of these
data. Finally we propose some crucial direct tests of the adaptive behavior.

lattice-regularized heavy-light operators. We consider both the commonly used

algebra within the extended Field-Antifield formalism is further pursued. Using
a Pauli-Villars (PV) regularization of the generating functional at one loop

regulator. The analysis of this expression allows to conclude that recently
found ghost number one cocycles with nontrivial antifield dependence can not
appear in PV regularization. Afterwards, the extended Field-Antifield formalism
is further completed by incorporating quantum effects of the extra variables,
i.e., by explicitly taking into account the regularization of the extra sector.
In this context, invariant PV regulators are constructed from non-invariant
ones, leading to an alternative interpretation of the Wess-Zumino action as the
local counterterm relating invariant and non-invariant regularizations.
Finally, application of the above ideas to the bosonic string reproduces the
well-known Liouville action and the shift $(26-D)\rightarrow(25-D)$ at one
