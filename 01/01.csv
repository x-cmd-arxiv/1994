  139-158",,,"cs.AI",,"  A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous
agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R)
programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the
continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action
is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter
binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other
circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it
is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the
contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R
programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is
compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe
some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and
actual mobile robots.

while top quark and toponium physics could still turn up at LEP-II.

cannot be related to four-quark operators. A peculiar property of this operator
is that it does not contribute to two-jet production at hadron colliders, at
the level of one operator insertion and leading-order in alpha_s; therefore we
study its effects on three jet events. To calculate the helicity amplitudes
induced by this operator we make extensive use of collinear factorization. We
propose several ways of detecting the tr(G^3) signal, one of which exploits its
non-trivial behavior under azimuthal rotations of two almost collinear jets.

expansions (of functions in $L^p,\ 1\leq p \leq \infty$, in one or more
dimensions) converge pointwise almost everywhere, and identify the Lebesgue set
of a function as a set of full measure on which they converge. It is shown that
unlike the Fourier summation kernel, wavelet summation kernels $P_j$ are
bounded by radial decreasing $L^1$ convolution kernels. As a corollary it
follows that best $L^2$ spline approximations on uniform meshes converge
pointwise almost everywhere. Moreover, summation of wavelet expansions is
partially insensitive to order of summation. \footnote We also give necessary
and sufficient conditions for given rates of convergence of wavelet expansions
in the sup norm. Such expansions have order of convergence $s$ if and only if
the basic wavelet $\psi$ is in the homogeneous Sobolev space $H^{-s-d/2}_h$. We
also present equivalent necessary and sufficient conditions on the scaling
function. The above results hold in one and in multiple dimensions.

definitions of percolation theory nor to rehearse the general physical notions
of universality and renormalization (an important technique to be described in
Part Two). It was rather to describe as concretely as possible, although in
hypothetical form, the geometric aspects of universality, especially conformal
invariance, in the context of percolation, and to present the numerical results
that support the hypotheses. On the other hand, one ulterior purpose is to draw
the attention of mathematicians to the mathematical problems posed by the
physical notions. Some precise basic definitions are necessary simply to orient
the reader. Moreover a brief description of scaling and universality on the one
hand and of renormalization on the other is also essential in order to
establish their physical importance and to clarify their mathematical content.
