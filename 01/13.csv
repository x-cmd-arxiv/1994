  dan@nordita.dk; Astronomy & Astrophyics in press, NORDITA-94/5 A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The formation of the resonance lines of neutral boron in solar-type stellar
atmospheres is investigated taking into account effects of departures from
local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE effects). The latter are due to a
combination of overionisation and optical pumping in resonance lines, both
caused by the hot, non-local, ultraviolet radiation fields in the line-forming
regions. They lead to an underestimation of the boron abundance when analysis
methods assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are used. The abundance
correction, for the 249.7~nm resonance line, amounts to $+$0.6 dex for the
metal-poor star HD140283 and $+$0.4 dex for Procyon. No significant NLTE
effects are predicted for the Sun. Applying the abundance correction on the
results for HD140283 of Duncan et al. (1992) leads to a B/Be ratio well above
the minimum value required by spallation production of beryllium. The
reliability of the results in view of atomic and atmospheric uncertainties is
discussed. With the possible exception of photospheric inhomogeneity, it seems
unlikely that these could remove the effect for HD140283.

magnify different parts of the rotating stellar disk by varying amounts. The
differential magnification will cause a shift in the centroid of the star's
spectral lines during the lensing event. The shift is proportional to the ratio
of the stellar radius to the projected separation of the Macho from the star.
It therefore provides a direct measure of the Einstein ring radius, and so also
a measure of the Macho's proper motion (angular speed). This measurement can
remove some of the degeneracy between mass, distance to the lens, and
transverse velocity that exists in the interpretation of results from ongoing
microlensing experiments, and is an independent test of the lensing nature of
the event. We show that using the high precision attainable by stellar radial
velocity measurements, it is possible to measure proper motions for $\sim 10\%$
of Machos that lens A-stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), i.e.\ $\sim
7\%$ of the type of relatively high-magnification events that have been
reported to date. If this proper-motion measurement were combined with a
parallax measurement of the ``reduced velocity'', then the Macho mass,
distance, speed, and direction could each be separately determined. The shift
can be measured for $\sim 20\%$ of the A-star events generated by Machos in the
dark halo of the LMC. This in turn would provide a measurement of the fraction
of LMC vs. Galactic Macho events.

Imry-Ma estimate of Huse for the equilibrium roughness. The dynamical exponent
is $z=1-2\epsilon/9+O(\epsilon^2)<1$, resulting in unusual dynamical

fermion-gravity system in the physical-time defined by an additional coupled
(''clock''-) scalar field. We construct the Hamiltonian operator that evolves
the system in this physical time. We show that this Hamiltonian is finite,
diffeomorphism invariant, and has a simple geometrical action. The theory
fermions+gravity evolving in the clock time is finally given by the
combinatorial and geometrical action of this Hamiltonian on a set of graphs
