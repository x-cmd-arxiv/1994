bursts with identical light curves, separated in time and differing only by the
scaling of their amplitudes. However, noise may make them difficult to identify
as lensed images. Furthermore, faint, intrinsically similar, yet distinct light
curves may be falsely identified as lensing events. In this paper we develop
two statistical tests to distinguish noisy burst light curves. We use Fourier
analysis techniques to analyze the signals for both intrinsic variability and
variability due to noise. We are able to determine the noise level, and we
compare the bursts only at frequency channels that are signal dominated.
Utilizing these methods, we are able to make quantitative statements about
whether two bursts are distinct. We apply these statistics to scaled versions
of two subbursts of GRB 910503--- subbursts previously investigated by
Wambsganss (1993) using a different statistical test. We find that our methods
are able to distinguish these bursts at slightly smaller amplitudes than those
at which Wambsganss's method succeeds. We then apply our techniques to
``candidate"" lensing events taken from the BATSE catalogue, and we find that
nearly all of them, except for the very shortest ones (durations $\aproxlt 0.3
~s$), are distinguishable. We therefore expect that a majority of bursts will
be disinguishable from one another.

exhibit identical light curves. We improve upon previous calculations of GRB
lensing by using revised cosmological burst models based upon better knowledge
of burst spectra, and we consider several sets of cosmological parameters. Only
lensing by the known population of galaxies is considered, and we compute the
lensing rate and amplification bias using three different lens models. Assuming
that 800 bursts per year are above the detection threshold of the BATSE
experiment on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, we predict one lensing event
every 1.5--25 years, with a median time delay between images of about 7 days.
However, BATSE has an instrumental efficiency of about 12\% for detecting
double bursts, decreasing the detection rate to fewer than one per century for
some cosmological parameters. This inefficiency can be overcome partially if
cases of quadruple imaging by elliptical potentials are common, but simulations
show that lensing by elliptical potentials enhances the detection rate by only
about 20\%. We conclude that it is unlikely that the BATSE experiment will
detect a lensed burst, but that a future experiment, which is either much more
sensitive or has a much more efficient duty cycle, could.

The method is applied to determine how sensitive the derived peculiar velocity
field is to the characteristics of the sample used. The possibility that the
iras galaxies do not trace the general galaxy population is explored adopting a
simple model of linear biasing between the iras and optical samples. We find
that the velocity fields derived from the two samples are consistent, within
the estimated shot noise error, for the case of no relative bias. This result
suggests that the predicted peculiar velocity field based on iras samples is
not sensitive to the sampling properties of iras galaxies. Combined with
previous suggestion of a relative biasing of iras galaxies on small scales
(about 5 h^-1Mpc), this result suggests scale dependent biasing.

electrons are located on a ring, is investigated in detail using the Bethe

quasi periodicity becomes an exact half quantum flux periodicity. However the
character of the state created on the ring is different in both cases. In the

from each other as possible. We show by numerical solution of Bethe ansaz
equations that for three electrons the flux periodicity of the ground state

as tree graphs. CP violation arises due to the difference in the CKM phase
between these graphs. We model the final state interaction of the hadronic
system using the low lying $k_i$ resonances. We find that radiative decays of B
mesons give rise to four of the five kaonic resonances at about $1$ to $7 \%$

formation of the other three higher resonances is roughly the same as that of
$K^*(892)$, which was recently seen at CLEO. In addition to the partial rate
asymmetry which arises due to interference between resonances of the same

Lie algebras in 2-dimensions. The charge corresponding to BRST symmetry derived
from this solution in terms of the phase space variables by using the Noether
procedure, and the one found due to the BFV-method are compared and found to
coincide. $W_3$ algebra, formulated in terms of a continuous variable is
emploied in the mentioned gauge theory to construct a $W_3$ topological
gravity. Moreover, its gauge fixing is briefly discussed.

particle physics) is recovered in our approach. Reductions of the universal
differential calculus to `lower-dimensional' differential calculi are
considered. The `complete reduction' leads to a differential calculus on a
periodic lattice which is related to q-calculus.

experiments in binary mixture convection. For strongly negative separation
ratio, these pulse structures can be described as two interacting fronts of
opposite orientation. An analytical study of the front solutions in a real
Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled to a mean field is presented here as a first
approach to the pulse solution. The additional mean field becomes important
when the mass diffusion in the mixture is small as is the case in liquids.
Within this framework it can lead to a hysteretic transition between slow and
fast fronts when the Rayleigh number is changed.
