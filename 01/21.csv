  In the last few years considerable progress has been achieved in our
understanding of the decays of heavy flavour hadrons. One can now calculate
inclusive transition rates in QCD proper through an expansion in inverse powers
of the heavy flavour quark mass without recourse to phenomenological
assumptions. The non-perturbative contributions are treated systematically in
this way; they are found to produce corrections of order a few percent in
beauty decays, i.e. typically somewhat smaller than the perturbative
corrections. One finds, among other things: (a) The lifetime of $B^-$ mesons is
predicted to be longer than that of $B^0$ mesons by several percent. (b) The
QCD prediction for the semileptonic branching ratio of $B$ mesons appears to
exceed present experimental values. We discuss the implications of this
discrepancy. The phenomenological engineering that has been developed for the
description of {\em exclusive} two-body modes of $B$ mesons has reached a
mature stage and awaits more precise and detailed experimental tests. First
steps towards a genuine QCD treatment of these modes are being made.

of the equal-time limit and investigate its convergence in perturbation theory.
We find that the equal-time limit vanishes for amplitudes with the effective
dimension $d_{\em eff} \leq -2$ and is finite for those with $d_{\em eff} =-1$
but without nontrivial discontinuity. Otherwise we expect divergent equal-time
limits. We also find that, if the ETC's involved in verifying an Jacobi
identity exist, the identity is satisfied.
  Under these circumstances, we show in the Yang-Mills theory that the ETC of
the $0$ component of the BRST current with each other vanishes to all orders in
perturbation theory if the theory is free from the chiral anomaly, from which
we conclude that $[\, Q\,,\,Q\,]=0$, where $Q$ is the BRST charge. For the case
that the chiral anomaly is not canceled, we use various broken Ward identities
to show that $[\, Q\,,\,Q\,]$ is finite and $[\,Q\,,\,[\, Q\,,\,Q]\,]$ vanishes
at the one-loop level and that they start to diverge at the two-loop level
unless there is some unexpected cancellation mechanism that improves the degree
of convergence.

B327 (1994) 90-94","10.1016/0370-2693(94)91534-2",,"hep-th",,"  The loop equations in the $U(N)$ lattice gauge theory are represented in the
form of constraints imposed on a generating functional for the Wilson loop
correlators. These constraints form a closed algebra with respect to
commutation. This algebra generalizes the Virasoro one, which is known to
appear in one-matrix models in the same way. The realization of this algebra in
terms of the infinitesimal changes of generators of the loop space is given.
The representations on the tensor fields on the loop space, generalizing the
integer spin conformal fields, are constructed. The structure constants of the
algebra under consideration being independent of the coupling constants, almost
all the results are valid in the continuum.
