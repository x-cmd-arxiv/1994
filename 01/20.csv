analysed with a simple yet accurate disc--halo model of the Milky Way Galaxy.
This comprises a luminous exponential disc embedded in a flattened dark matter
halo with density varying like ${\rm distance}^{-1.8}$. Including a disc has
the important effect of lowering the implied masses of the dark matter objects.
For the possible detection reported by Alcock et al (1993), the inferred mass
of the lens lies in the range $\sim 0.01 - 0.15 M_\odot$. The candidate events
of Aubourg et al (1993) have slightly larger implied masses of $\sim 0.025 -
0.35\ M_\odot$ and $\sim 0.03 - 0.45\ M_\odot$ respectively. These are
consistent with the deflecters being either brown dwarfs or low mass stars. If
there is no disc dark matter and the halo is completely composed of baryonic
dark objects of typical mass $ \sim 0.08\ M_\odot$, then the monitoring of $1.8
\times 10^6$ stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud will provide at least $8-9$
detections a year, in the limit of $100 \%$ efficiency.

B322 (1994) 33-37","10.1016/0370-2693(94)90487-1",,"nucl-th hep-ph",,"  A double phi peak structure in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum from
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is proposed as a signal for the phase
transition from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic matter. The low mass phi
peak results from the decay of phi mesons with reduced in-medium mass during
the transition. Furthermore, the measurement of the transverse momentum
distribution of these low mass phi mesons offers a viable means for determining
the temperature of the phase transition.

$\Sigma$ hypernuclei in $(e,e'K^{+})$ reactions at around CEBAF energies are
given. Because of dominant spin-flip amplitudes and large momentum transfers,
unnatural parity states and stretched states of hypernuclei are favorably
excited. They are compared with quasifree hyperon productions.
