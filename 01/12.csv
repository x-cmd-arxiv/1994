with at most two terms) and the schemes and varieties associated to them. The
class of binomial ideals contains many classical examples from algebraic
geometry, and it has numerous applications within and beyond pure mathematics.
The ideals defining toric varieties are precisely the binomial prime ideals.
Our main results concern primary decomposition: If $I$ is a binomial ideal then
the radical, associated primes, and isolated primary components of $I$ are
again binomial, and $I$ admits primary decompositions in terms of binomial
primary ideals. A geometric characterization is given for the affine algebraic
sets that can be defined by binomials. Our structural results yield
sparsity-preserving algorithms for finding the radical and primary
decomposition of a binomial ideal.

density contrast with top hat smoothing on scale $R$) which allows data on
different scales to be readily compared. As a preliminary application, we
normalise the spectrum using the ten degree variance of the COBE data, and then
compare the prediction with a limited sample of low energy data, for the MDM
model with various values of $n$, $\Omega_\nu$ and $h$. With $h=.5$, the data
constrain the spectral index to the range $0.7\lsim n \lsim 1.2$. If
gravitational waves contribute to the cmb anisotropy with relative strength
$R=6(1-n)$ (as in some models of inflation), the lower limit on $n$ is
increased to about $0.85$. The uncertainty in $h$ widens this band by about
$0.1$ at either end.

objects that collapse out of a Gaussian random field of initial density
perturbations. The population of low-spin systems is significant for any viable
power spectrum of primordial density perturbations. Most objects form just
above the cosmological Jeans mass (\sim 10^5 M_sun) at high redshifts z>10. In
the standard cold dark matter cosmology, the comoving density of 10^{6-7} M_sun
objects with viscous evolution times shorter than 10^{6-7} years is about
10^{-3} (h/0.5)^3 Mpc^{-3}, comparable to the local density of bright galaxies.

2-point spatial correlation function xi(r), a very simplified -- yet
surprisingly effective -- model for the linear density fluctuations power
spectrum can be constructed. We first relate the observed large-scale shape of
xi(r) to a power-law form for the power spectrum, P(k)\propto k^{-2.2}. For a
plausible value of the bias parameter b = 1/sigma_8 ~ 1.8, one has (delta_rho /
rho)_{rms} ~ 1 r ~ 3.5/h Mpc, suggesting that the change of slope observed in
xi(r) around this scale marks the transition between the linear and nonlinear
gravitational regimes. Under this working hypothesis, we use a simple
analytical form to fit the large-scale correlations constraints together with
the COBE CMB anisotropy measurement, thus constructing a simple
phenomenological model for the linear power spectrum. Despite its simplicity,
the model fits remarkably well directly estimated power spectra from different
optical galaxy samples, and when evolved through an N-body simulation it
provides a good match to the observed galaxy correlations. One of the most
interesting features of the model is the small-scale one-dimensional velocity
dispersion produced: sigma_{1d} = 450 Km s^{-1} at 0.5/h Mpc and sigma_{1d} =

new formulation, when applied to the $\rho$ parameter for $m_t\approx158$~GeV,
gives a result of similar magnitude to those previously obtained. In fact, it
is quite close to our ``resonance'' calculation. We also present a simple
estimate of the size of the threshold effects based on an elementary Bohr-atom

From general arguments and explicit examples their consistency with (braid-)
statistics and locality was established. This work addresses to the
reconstruction of quantum symmetries and algebras of field operators. For every
algebra $\A$ of observables satisfying certain standard assumptions, an
appropriate quantum symmetry is found. Field operators are obtained which act
on a positive definite Hilbert space of states and transform covariantly under
the quantum symmetry. As a substitute for Bose/Fermi (anti-) commutation
relations, these fields are demonstrated to obey local braid relation.

gauge group $SU(N)$, a useful toy model of QCD strings, is supersymmetric for a
certain ratio of quark mass and gauge coupling constant. Here we study the
theory in the vicinity of the supersymmetric point; in particular we exhibit
the algebraic structure of the model and show that the mass splittings as one
moves away from the supersymmetric point obey a universal relation of the form
${M_i}^2(B)-{M_i}^2(F)=M_i\delta m+O(\delta m^3)$. We discuss the connection of
this relation to string and quark model expectations and verify it numerically
for large $N$. At least for low lying states the $O(\delta m^3)$ corrections
are extremely small. We also discuss a natural generalization of QCD$_2$ with
an infinite number of couplings, which preserves SUSY. This leads to a Landau
-- Ginzburg description of the theory, and may be useful for defining a scaling
limit in which smooth worldsheets appear.

$\bar f(z,\bar z)\in[SU(N_C)]^c$ the complexification of $SU(N_C)$ , reveals
certain subtleties. ``Physical"" massive color singlet states seem to exist.
When coupled to $N_F$ quarks the coupling constant is renormalized in such a
way that it vanishes for the pure Yang- Mills case. This renders the above
states massless and unphysical. In the abelian case, on the other hand, the
known results of the Schwinger model are reproduced with no need of such a
renormalization.
  The massless $QCD_2$ theory is analyzed in similar terms and peculiar massive
states appear, with a mass of $e_c\sqrt {N_F \over 2\pi}$.

three-cluster model. In $^6$He a 2$^+$, in $^6$Li a 2$^+$ and a 1$^+$, and in
$^6$Be the 0$^+$ ground state and a 2$^+$ excited state is found. The other
experimentally known 2$^+$ state of $^6$Li cannot be localized by our present
method. We have found no indication for the existence of the predicted 1$^-$
soft dipole state in $^6$He. We argue that the sequential decay mode of $^6$He
through the resonant states of its two-body subsystem can lead to peaks in the
excitation function. This process can explain the experimental results in the
case of $^{11}$Li, too. We propose an experimental analysis, which can decide
between the soft dipole mode and the sequential decay mode.
