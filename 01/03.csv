avoidance (zoa), within $6000\kms$ of the Local Group, using potent
reconstruction from peculiar velocities of galaxies. The interpolation into the
zoa is based on the assumed gravitational nature of the velocity field implying
a potential flow. The main dynamical features at a distance r=4000 km/s are (a)
the peak of the Great Attractor connecting Centaurus and Pavo at l=330, (b) a
moderate bridge connecting Perseus-Pisces and Cepheus at l= 140, and (c) an
extension of a large void from the southern Galactic hemisphere into the zoa
near the direction of Puppis, l=220-270. We find a strong correlation between
the mass density and the IRAS and optical galaxy density at $b=+-20, which
indicates that the main dynamical features in the zoa should also be seen in
galaxy surveys through the Galactic plane. The gravitational acceleration at
the Local Group, based on the mass distribution out to 6000 km/s, is strongly
affected by the mass distribution in the zoa: its direction changes by 31 when
the |b| < 20 zoa is included, bringing it to within 4 +- 19 of the CMB dipole.

low--energy behaviour of a daughter state in the next level of the hierarchy is
described by an interacting system of quasiparticles of the parent state.
Taking the filled lowest Landau level as the parent state, we examine
analytically the quantitative consequences of this approach for electrons
interacting via a pseudopotential interaction. It is shown that the ground
state energy per particle in the daughter state at a filling factor $2/3$ is
exactly equal to that of a system of quasiholes in the parent state with half
filling, precisely as predicted by the hierarchical approach. This is achieved
with {\em only up to two--particle interactions} in the effective Hamiltonian
for the quasiholes. Their single particle energy and two--particle interaction
are derived. The results are generalized to the other filling factors
attainable from the filled Landau level.

antiquark. As a result the confining potential is a Lorentz scalar, and the
Coulomb part the fourth component of a 4-vector. The energy spectrum of the
Dirac equation is considered for these potentials. Numerical calculations of
energy eigenvalues $E=E_{n\kappa}$ are performed, and some exact solutions of
the Dirac equation in the case $E=0$ are found. An effective-potential method

developed. The connection with experimental spectra of $D$- and $B$-mesons is
