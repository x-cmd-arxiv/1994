of the observed features may be a useful guide to current and future
experiments. The first year COBE-DMR sky maps were analyzed in order to
identify the most significant hot and cold spots. The statistical significance
of potential spots of cosmic origin was evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations.
The area, eccentricity, and location of the most significant spots are given.

screening suppressed by disallowing overhangs blocking large gaps, are studied
by extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the temporal and size dependence of the
growing interface width. Despite earlier finding that for such models the
deposit density tends to increase away from the substrate, our numerical
results place them clearly within the standard KPZ universality class.

chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The subjects treated in Part I
include the vacuum structure of QCD, mass spectra and coupling constants of
hadrons, flavor mixing in mesons, the violation of the OZI rule in baryons, and
the validity of the chiral perturbation in QCD. A subtle interplay between the
axial anomaly and the current-quark masses is shown to play important roles,
and a realistic evaluation of the strangeness and heavy quark contents of
hadrons is given. In Part II, the NJL model is applied to the system at finite
temperature ($T$) and density
  ($\rho$) relevant to the early universe, interior of the neutron stars and
the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The subjects treated here include
the quark condensates in the medium, meson properties at finite $T$ ($\rho$)
and their experimental implications. A special attention is paid to fluctuation
phenomena near the critical temperature. (to be published in Physics Reports)

Flavor Conservation (NFC). The couplings of a charged scalar $H_i^{\pm}$ to up
quarks, down quarks and charged leptons depend on three new complex parameters,
$X_i$, $Y_i$ and $Z_i$, respectively. We prove relations among these
parameters. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of phenomenological
constraints on the couplings of the lightest charged scalar: $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.
We find that the general MHDM may differ significantly from its minimal
version, the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM).
