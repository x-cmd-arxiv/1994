action-governed systems. These follow directly from the action with no need to
go via the equations of motion. When some of the degrees of freedom are of the
same type a tensor virial theorem presents itself. Further generalizations are
discussed.
  Symmetries of the action may lead to identities involving the VR.
  Beside pointing to a unified provenance of the VR, and affording general
systematics of them, our method is a simple prescription for deriving such
relations. It is particularly useful for treating high-derivative and non-local
theories. We demonstarte the procedure with several examples.

  Testing the Disk/Halo Interface","Plain TeX, ST-801",,"10.1086/174128",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a study of the radio emission from rotating, charged dust grains
immersed in the ionized gas constituting the thick, H$\alpha$-emitting disk of
many spiral galaxies. Using up-to-date optical constants, the charge on the
grains exposed to the diffuse galactic UV flux has been calculated. An
analytical approximation for the grain charge has been derived, which is then
used to obtain the grain rotation frequency. Grains are found to have
substantial radio emission peaked at a cutoff frequency in the range
10-100~GHz, depending on the grain size distribution and on the efficiency of
the radiative damping of the grain rotation. The dust radio emission is
compared to the free-free emission from the ionized gas component; some
constraints on the magnetic field strength in the observed dusty filaments are
also discussed. The model can be used to test the disk-halo interface
environment in spiral galaxies, to determine the amount and size distribution
of dust in their ionized component, and to investigate the rotation mechanisms
for the dust. Numerical estimates are given for experimental purposes.

in detail. We perform a large-time asymptotic analysis of these random walks
and use the results to determine the Hausdorff dimension of the process. We
obtain exact results in terms of Hurwitz functions (incomplete zeta functions)
for the probability of a walker going from one region of the spherical lattice
to another. Finally, we show that the probability that the paths of $K$
independent random walkers will intersect vanishes in the continuum limit if
$D> {{2K}\over{K-1}}$.

string at the self-dual radius. The model is an analytic continuation of the
$A_{k+1}$ minimal model to $k=-3$. We compute the superpotential and calculate
tachyon correlators in the Landau-Ginzburg framework. The results are in
complete agreement with matrix model calculations. We identify the momentum one
tachyon as the puncture operator, non-negative momentum tachyons as primary
fields, and negative momentum ones as descendants. The model thus has an
infinite number of primary fields, and the topological metric vanishes on the
small phase space when restricted to these. We find a parity invariant
multi-contact algebra with irreducible contact terms of arbitrarily large
number of fields. The formulation of this Landau-Ginzburg description in terms
of period integrals coincides with the genus zero $W_{1+\infty}$ identities of
two-dimensional string theory. We study the underlying Toda lattice integrable
hierarchy in the Lax formulation and find that the Landau-Ginzburg
superpotential coincides with a derivative of the Baker-Akhiezer wave function
in the dispersionless limit. This establishes a connection between the
topological and integrable structures. Guided by this connection we derive
relations formally analogous to the string equation.
