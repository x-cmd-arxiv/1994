separations less than approximately 20\hkpc, is used to examine the rise in the
merger rate with redshift and the statistical relations between close pairs and
the field galaxy population. Redshifts have been obtained for 14 galaxies ($V
\le 22.5$) that are in close ($\theta < 6\arcs$) pairs, along with a comparison
sample of 38 field galaxies. Two color photometry is available for about 1000
galaxies in the same fields. The average redshift of the $V\le22.5$ field
population is 0.36, statistically equal to the average redshift of 0.42 for the
pairs. The similarity of the two redshift distributions, $\Delta z\le 0.1$,
limits any differential luminosity enhancement of close pairs to less than half
a magnitude. The pairs are somewhat bluer than the field and have nearly twice
the average [O~II] detection rate of the field, but the differences are not
statistically significant. The field population has an angular correlation at
separations of $\theta\le$6\arcs\ higher than the inward extrapolation of
$\omega(\theta)\propto \theta^{-0.8}$, which may be a population of
``companions'' not present at the current epoch, or, luminosity enhancement of
intrinsically faint galaxies in pairs. Physical pairs comprise about 7\% of the
faint galaxies in our survey fields. The same physical separation applied to
local galaxies finds only 2.6\% in pairs. If the rise in close low relatively
velocity pairs with redshift is parameterized as $(1+z)^m$, then $m=2.9\pm0.8$.

in hierarchical theories of structure formation. Our model incorporates the
formation and merging of dark matter halos, the shock heating and radiative
cooling of baryonic gas gravitationally confined in these halos, the formation
of stars regulated by the energy released by evolving stars and supernovae, the
merging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution of the
stellar populations that are formed. The procedure that we describe is very
flexible and can be applied to any hierarchical clustering theory. We explore
the effects of varying the stellar initial mass function, star formation rates
and galaxy merging. The results we compare with an extensive range of
observational data, including the B and K galaxy luminosity functions, galaxy
colours, the Tully-Fisher relation and galaxy number counts.These data strongly
constrain the models and enable the relative importance of each of the physical
process to be assessed. We present a broadly successful model defined by a
plausible choice of parameters. This fiducial model produces a much more
acceptable luminosity function than most previous studies. This is achieved
through a modest rate of galaxy mergers and strong suppression of star
formation in halos of low circular velocity. However, it fails to produce
galaxies as red as many observed ellipticals and, compared with the observed
Tully-Fisher relation, the model galaxies have circular velocities which are
too large. ** uuencoded compressed postscript file containing all text and

an exponential in the inverse field, modified by universal and nonuniversal
power-law prefactors. Quantitative droplet-theory predictions are numerically
verified, and small deviations are shown to depend nonuniversally on the

field dependence and statistical properties of the lifetimes are different. The
field marking the crossover between the weak-field regime, in which the decay
is dominated by a single droplet, and the intermediate-field regime, in which
it is dominated by a finite droplet density, vanishes logarithmically with
