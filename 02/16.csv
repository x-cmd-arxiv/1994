flow of an incompressible fluid is described in the range of scales between the
correlation length of the flow and the diffusion scale. That corresponds to the
so-called Batchelor regime where the velocity is replaced by its large-scale
gradient. The probability distribution of the scalar in the locally comoving
reference frame is expressed via the probability distribution of the line
stretching rate. The description of line stretching can be reduced to a
classical problem of the product of many random matrices with a unit
determinant. We have found the change of variables that allows one to map the
matrix problem onto a scalar one and to thereby prove the central limit theorem
for the stretching rate statistics. The proof is valid for any finite
correlation time of the velocity field. Whatever the statistics of the velocity
field, the statistics of the passive scalar (averaged over time locally in
space) is shown to approach gaussianity with increase in the Peclet number $Pe$
(the pumping-to-diffusion scale ratio). The first $n<\ln Pe$ simultaneous
correlation functions are expressed via the flux of the square of the scalar
and only one factor depending on the velocity field: the mean stretching rate,
which can be calculated analytically in limiting cases. Non-Gaussian tails of

quark model, associated $J/\psi$ plus open charm photoproduction on charm
quarks in a proton via partonic subprocess $\gamma c\to J/\psi c$ is discussed.
It is shown that the value and energy dependence of the cross section for such
process remarkably depends on the choice of charm distribution function in a
proton. In the region of small $z=E_J/E_{\gamma}<0.2$ the contribution of the
$\gamma c\to J/\psi c$ subprocess in the inelastic $J/\psi$ photoproduction
spectra is larger than the contribution of the photon-gluon fusion subprocess.
At the energy range of HERA collider intrinsic charm contribution in the total
inclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction cross section may be equal to 4\% of the
dominant contribution of photon-gluon fusion mechanism.

light-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation, both numerically and analytically. The
light-front Einstein-Schr\""odinger equation for mesonic mass reduces to the 't
Hooft equation in the large $N$ limit, $g^2N$ fixed, where $g$ is the coupling
constant. Hadronic masses are numerically obtained in the region of $m^2 \ll
g^2N$, where $m$ is the bare quark (q) mass. The lightest mesonic and baryonic
states are almost in valence. The second lightest mesonic state is highly
relativistic in the sense that it has a large 4-body ($ {\rm qq} \bar{\rm q}
\bar{\rm q} $) component in addition to the valence (${\rm q} \bar{\rm q}$)
one. In the strong coupling limit our results are consistent with the
prediction of the bosonization for ratios of the lightest and second lightest
mesonic masses to the lightest baryonic one. Analytic solutions to the lightest
hadronic masses are obtained, with a reasonable approximation, as
$\sqrt{2Cm}(1-1/N^2)^{1/4}$ in the mesonic case and
$\sqrt{CmN(N-1)}(1-1/N^2)^{1/4}$ in the baryonic case, where
$C=(g^2N\pi/6)^{1/2}$. The solutions well reproduce the numerical ones. The
$N$- and $m$-dependences of the hadronic masses are explicitly shown by the
analytical solutions.

dilaton gravity theories with an emphasis on the CGHS model. We use an approach
where a canonical transformation is constructed such that the constraints take
a quadratic form. The required canonical transformation is obtained by using a
method based on the B\""acklund transformation from the Liouville theory. We
quantize dilaton gravity in terms of the new variables, where it takes a form
of a bosonic string theory with background charges. Unitarity is then
established by going into a light-cone gauge. As a direct consequence, black
holes in this theory do not violate unitarity, and there is no information
loss. We argue that the information escapes during the evaporation process. We
also discuss the implications of this quantization scheme for the quantum fate
of real black holes. The main conclusion is that black holes do not have to
violate quantum mechanics.
