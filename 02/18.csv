matter fields defined on a special kind of a dynamical random lattice. Time is
discretized into regular intervals, whereas the discretization of space is
random and dynamical. A triangulation is associated to each distribution of the
spacetime points using the flat metric of the embedding space. We introduce a
diffeomorphism invariant, bilinear scalar action, but no ``pure gravity''
action.
  Evidence for the existence of a non-trivial continuum limit is provided by
showing that the zero momentum scalar excitation has a finite energy in the
limit of vanishing lattice spacing. Assuming the existence of localized low
energy states which are described by a natural set of observables, we show that
an effective curved metric will be induced dynamically. The components of the
metric tensor are identified with quasi-local averages of certain microscopic
properties of the quantum spacetime. The Planck scale is identified with the
highest mass scale of the matter sector.

perturbation; making their strengths infinitely repulsive one obtains
Dirichlet, respectively Neumann boundary conditions in the path integral.

also to Pettis-norm) convergence in $\l1$. It is shown that tightness is a
necessary and sufficient condition to pass from limited to strong convergence.
Other implications between several modes of convergence in $\l1$ are also
studied.

neutrinos by ${}^{127}$I, in connection with a proposed solar neutrino
detector. With standard-solar-model fluxes and an in-medium value of -1.0 for
the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$, we obtain a ${}^8$B-neutrino cross
section of 3.3$\times 10^{-42}$, about 50\% larger than in our previous work,
and a ${}^7$Be cross section that is less certain but nevertheless also larger
than before. We then apply the improved techniques to higher incoming energies
that obtain at the LAMPF beam dump, where an experiment is underway to finalize
a calibration of the ${}^{127}$I with electron neutrinos from muon decay. We
find that forbidden operators, which play no role in solar-neutrino absorption,
contribute nonnegligibly to the LAMPF cross section, and that the preliminary
LAMPF mean value is significantly larger than our prediction.

calculating the excited states of one dimensional systems, we determine
approximately the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the anharmonic oscillator,
described by the Hamiltonian $H= p^2/2 + g x^4$. We use ground state
post-gaussian trial wave functions of the form $\Psi(x) =
  N{\rm{exp}}[-b |x|^{2n}]$, where $n$ and $b$ are continuous variational
parameters. This algorithm is based on the hierarchy of Hamiltonians related by
supersymmetry (SUSY) and the factorization method. We find that our two
parameter family of trial wave functions yields excellent energy eigenvalues
and wave functions for the first few levels of the anharmonic oscillator.

completely integrable system with polynomial invariants on $\Rd$ and on
$\C{2d}$ for each $d\geq1$; in fact the invariants are not only in involution
for one Poisson bracket, but for a large class of polynomial Poisson brackets,
indexed by the family of polynomials in two variables. We show that the complex
invariant manifolds are isomorphic to affine parts of $d$-fold symmetric
products of a deformation of the algebraic curve $F(x,y)=0$, and derive the
structure of the real invariant manifolds from it. We also exhibit Lax
equations for the hyperelliptic case (i.e., when $F(x,y)$ is of the form
$y^2+f(x)$) and we show that in this case the invariant manifolds are affine
parts of distinguished (non-linear) subvarieties of the Jacobians of the
curves. As an application the geometry of the H\'enon-Heiles hierarchy --- a
family of superimposable integrable polynomial potentials on the plane --- is
revealed and Lax equations for the hierarchy are given.

degenerate (i.e., associated to a degenerate Poisson bracket) completely
integrable systems on (a dense subset of) the space $\R^{2d+n+1}$, called the
generalized master systems. It turns out that certain generalized master
systems (with different Poisson brackets and different Hamiltonians) determine
the same Hamiltonian vector fields (and are therefore different descriptions of
the same Hamiltonian system), and that the Poisson brackets of these systems
are compatible. Consequently, our class of generalized master systems actually
consists of a (smaller) class of completely integrable systems, and our
construction yields a multi-Hamiltonian structure for these systems. As an
application, we construct a multi-Hamiltonian structure for the so-called
master systems introduced by D. Mumford.
