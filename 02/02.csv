gravitational amplification by dark clouds rather than compact objects. These
clouds must be very dense with $M\sim 0.1 ~M_\odot$ and $R\la 10^{14}~{\rm

different sizes and masses. We therefore expect events of longer duration than
the ones reported by the MACHO and EROS groups but with light curves very
different from the ones derived assuming point mass lenses. We suggest that one
such event has already been observed in radio measurements of the quasar
1502+106. The abundances of free electrons, metals, complex molecules, and dust
grains are constrained to be very small suggesting that the clouds are formed
from a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium. Cosmic rays and background UV
radiation ionize a halo around the cloud. Radio waves from distant sources will
be scattered by the electrons in this halo, an effect which may have already
been observed in quasars such as 1502+106. We argue that dark clouds are a
viable alternative to compact objects for baryonic dark matter in the halo.

shear fields on the evolution of galactic scale fluctuations in a primordial
Gaussian random density field. Specifically, we study how the matter associated
with a galaxy-scale peak evolves, to determine whether the shear can affect the
peak's ability to form a virialized structure. We find that the evolution of
the mass distribution in the immediate surroundings of $\geq 1\sigma$ initial
density peaks is sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the shear. Its final
fate and configuration spans a plethora of possibilities, ranging from
accretion onto the peak to complete disruption. On the other hand, the mass
defining the peak itself always tends to form a virialized object, though a
given galaxy-scale peak need not necessarily form only one halo. Furthermore,
galaxy-size halos need not necessarily be associated with initial galaxy-scale
density peaks. Under certain conditions, the shear field is capable of breaking
up a single primordial peak into two (and perhaps, more) distinct halos, or of
promoting the growth of smaller-scale peaks into galaxy-size halos.

been assumed to be approximately isothermal with a non-zero core radius, which
is expected to be of the order of the size of the visible matter distribution.
Recently, the possibility has been raised that dark matter halos might be
singular in the sense that the dark matter density $\rho$ could increase
monotonically with radius $r$ down to a very small distance from the center of
galaxies or clusters. Such central cusps in the dark matter density could lead
to a high flux of gamma rays from WIMP dark matter annihilation. Here we
analyze two possibilities that have been discussed in the literature, $\rho
\propto r^{-n}$ with $n \approx 1\ {\rm or}\ 2$, and point out that such
density profiles are excluded by gravitional lensing analyses on cluster scales
and by the rotation curves of gas-rich, halo-dominated dwarf spirals on small
scales. We also point out that if spiral galaxies form by gas infall inside
dark matter halos, as they are expected to do in any hierarchical clustering
model, such profiles almost always lead to falling rotation curves after
infall, contrary to observations.

On the average, elliptical galaxies emit in the far-IR less than 1\% of their
bolometric luminosity, while S0's are about a factor of three brighter in the
far-IR. On the average, the photospheric emission of red giant stars can
account for 50--60\% of the $12\mic$ flux from early type galaxies; the
contribution from diffuse dust at this wavelength is $< 10\%$ in the case of
ellipticals,and may amount to 20--40\% for S0's. An additional, $\sim
30--40\%$, contribution from circumstellar emission from evolved giants with
mass loss (particularly OH/IR stars) seems to be required in the case of
ellipticals. This suggests a small but significant star formation activity in
these galaxies at a look-back time of 1--$2\,$Gyr, corresponding to about 10\%
of that typical of a disk galaxy having the same V-band luminosity. As for
S0's, the larger diffuse dust emission may swamp to some extent that of
circumstellar dust, which is indicated to be, on the average, $\lsim 20\%$. The
weak emission from diffuse interstellar dust, detected mostly at $60\mic$ and
$100\mic$, has color temperatures similar to those of disk galaxies; as in that

density perturbations in the present universe from the initial power spectrum
and the nature of dark matter. Observational constraints on the power spectrum
at different scales in the present epoch can, therefore, be used to eliminate
(or choose between) different theoretical models. Such a comparison is fairly
easy at large scales (at which linear theory is valid), and one can use
observations like the MBR anisotropy, large scale steaming motions etc to
constrain the models. But to discriminate between the models effectivley, it is
necessay to constrain the power spectrum at small scales. The most reliable
constraints on the power spectra at small scales come from the predicted
abundance of bound systems which can be estimated reasonably accurately using
Press-Schecter (or similar) methods$^1$. In the past, this method has been used
in conjunction with the quasar abundance$^{2-4}$ and cluster abundance$^{5-7}$.
We show here that the abundance of damped lyman alpha systems (DLAS,
hereafter), provides a far stronger constraint on the models for structure
formation. Models with a mixture of hot and cold dark matter $^{8-11}$ (which
are consistent with large scale observations) are strongly ruled out by the
DLAS constraints while models with cosmological constant $^{12}$ are marginally
inconsistent. It is also possible to combine the constraints from the abundance
of clusters, DLAS and QSO's to obtain model-independent bounds on the power
spectrum at the nonlinear scales. These bounds are to be respected by any
viable model for structure formation.

assuring supersymmetric consistency of both perturbative and non-perturbative
gauge interactions. At the perturbative level, we distinguish between the
holomorphic Wilsonian gauge couplings and the physically-measurable
momentum-dependent effective gauge couplings; the latter are affected by the
Konishi and the super-Weyl anomalies and their field-dependence is
non-holomorphic. At the non-perturbative level, we show how consistency of the

use this superpotential to determine the dependence of the supersymmetric

all mass levels in non-supersymmetric string theories, and find that a hidden
``misaligned supersymmetry'' must always appear in the string spectrum. We show
that this misaligned supersymmetry is ultimately responsible for the finiteness
of string amplitudes in the absence of full spacetime supersymmetry, and
therefore the existence of misaligned supersymmetry provides a natural
constraint on the degree to which spacetime supersymmetry can be broken in
string theory without destroying the finiteness of string amplitudes.
Misaligned supersymmetry also explains how the requirements of modular
invariance and absence of physical tachyons generically affect the distribution
of states throughout the string spectrum, and implicitly furnishes a
two-variable generalization of some well-known results in the theory of modular
functions.

belong to a linear N=1 supersymmetric multiplet L. We study the lagrangian
describing the coupling of one linear multiplet to chiral and gauge multiplets
in global and local supersymmetry, with particular emphasis on string
tree-level and loop-corrected effective actions. This theory is dual to an
equivalent one with chiral multiplets only. But the formulation with a linear
multiplet appears to have decisive advantages beyond string tree-level since,
in particular, <L> is the string loop-counting parameter and the duality
transformation is in general not exactly solvable beyond tree-level. This
formulation allows us to easily deduce some powerful non-renormalization
theorems in the effective theory and to obtain explicitly some loop corrections
to the string effective supergravity for simple compactifications. Finally, we
discuss the issue of supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation using this
formalism.

strings contain a term which acts like a tree level cosmological constant,
$\Lambda$. We analyse the static, spherically symmetric solutions to these
equations in $d = 4$ space time and show that the curvature scalar seen by the
strings is singular if $\Lambda \ne 0$. This singularity is naked. Requiring
its absence in our universe imposes the constraint $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 120}$
in natural units. {}From another point of view, our analysis implies that low
energy $d = 4$ non critical strings lead to naked singularities.
