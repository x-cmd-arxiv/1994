  (uuencoded compressed Postscript file, 12pp.)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the case that populations of sdB/sdOB/sdO-type stars may be a
common constituent of galactic stellar populations, responsible for the UV
upturn (`UVX') observed in the spectra of spiral bulges and normal galaxy
nuclei. Extreme Horizontal Branch stars with $\log g > 5$ and $\log \teff >
20,000K$ have emerged in the last few years as the most likely candidate for
the origin of the UVX. The magnitude of this far-UV flux in some systems (e.g.
NGC~1399, NGC~4649) indicates that galactic nuclear regions must contain larger
numbers of these subdwarfs than does the solar neighbourhood. This paper
summarizes the results of a quantitative study of the UV radiation from evolved
stellar populations. We have computed a large grid of stellar models in
advanced stages of evolution, as well as a set of isochrones for ages 2-20 Gyr,
for a wide range in composition. We use these calculations to derive synthetic
UV colour indices for stellar populations with hot components.

A is beamed radiation from the active nucleus which is Compton-scattered into
our line-of-sight. We derive the spectrum and degree of polarization of
scattered radiation when incident beamed radiation is scattered from a cold
($kT<<m_ec^2$) electron cloud moving with bulk relativistic motion along the
jet axis, and calculate results for an unpolarized, highly-beamed incident
power-law photon source. We fit the OSSE data from Centaurus A with this model
and find that if the scatterers are not moving relativistically, then the angle
the jet makes with respect to our line-of-sight is $61^\circ\pm 5^\circ$. We
predict a high degree of polarization of the scattered radiation below
$\sim300$ keV. Future measurements with X-ray and gamma-ray polarimeters could
be used to constrain or rule out such a scenario.

proposed, in which degrees of freedom of the sublattice magnetization and of
the chirality are separated. It is shown that low-lying states can be
accurately described with the present approximation. It was argued that
low-lying states play an important role in symmetry breaking. With help of this
approximation, we discuss the contribution of low-lying states to symmetry
breaking of two types, namely creation of the spontaneous sublattice
magnetization and the spontaneous chirality. Furthermore, to show an evidence
for the occurrence of the symmetry breaking, we numerically study the low-lying
states of finite systems of the XY and Heisenberg antiferromagnets. It is found
that the necessary conditions for the symmetry breaking to occur are satisfied
in these models.

tested against the known running of the QED coupling due to nonperturbative
QCD. An understanding of this low momentum running allows the calculation of
the couplings at a higher scale, $\Lambda_{pert}$, where technicolor becomes
perturbative. We provide numerical values for the changes in the three standard
model couplings between $m_Z$ and $\Lambda_{pert}$ due to technicolor, assuming
separately ``one doublet'' and ``one family'' technicolor models. The
distinction between a running and walking technicolor coupling is also

gap equation and lattice Monte-Carlo studies of symmetry breaking have found
that symmetry breaking ceases to occur when the number of fermion flavors

that there are no light scalar degrees of freedom present as the critical
number of flavors is approached from above (in the symmetric phase). Thus the
phase transition is not second order, rendering irrelevant the renormalization
group arguments for a fluctuation induced transition. However, the order
parameter vanishes continuously in the broken phase, so this transition is also
unlike a conventional first order phase transition.

the zero-potential (Neumann) boundary state. As the potential strength varies
from zero to infinity, the boundary state interpolates between the Neumann and
the Dirichlet values. The full S-matrix for scattering from the boundary, with
arbitrary particle production, is explicitly computed. To maintain unitarity,
it is necessary to attribute a hidden discrete ``soliton'' degree of freedom to
the boundary. The same unitarity puzzle occurs in the Kondo problem, and we
anticipate a similar solution.

numbers can lead to domain structures, which consist of regions with differing
wave numbers separated by domain walls. For domain structures well above
threshold we employ the appropriate phase equation and obtain detailed
qualitative agreement with recent experiments. Close to threshold a
fourth-order Ginzburg-Landau equation is used which describes a steady
bifurcation in systems with two competing critical wave numbers. The existence
and stability regime of domain structures is found to be very intricate due to
interactions with other modes.
  In contrast to the phase equation the Ginzburg-Landau equation allows a
spatially oscillatory interaction of the domain walls. Thus, close to threshold
domain structures need not undergo the coarsening dynamics found in the phase
equation far above threshold, and can be stable even without phase
conservation. We study their regime of stability as a function of their
(quantized) length. Domain structures are related to zig-zags in
two-dimensional systems. The latter are therefore expected to be stable only
when quenched far enough beyond the zig-zag instability.
