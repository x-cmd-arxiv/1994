with the analytical description of the merging histories of dark matter halos
presented in Lacey & Cole 1993, which is based on an extension of the Press-
Schechter method (Bond etal 1991,Bower 1991). We find the analytical
predictions for the halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to be
remarkably accurate. The analytical model is however expected to apply for
arbitrary Omega and general power spectra. Dark matter halos were identified in
the simulations using two different methods. For halos selected at mean
overdensities 100-200, the analytical mass function was found to provide a good
fit to the simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by the
spherical collapse model, with a typical error of <30% over a range of 1000 in
mass, which is the full dynamic range of our N-body simulations. This was
insensitive to the type of filtering used. Over a range of 100 - 1000 in mass,
there was also good agreement with the analytical predictions for merger rates,
including their dependence on the masses of the two halos involved and the time
interval being considered, and for formation times, including the dependence on
halo mass and formation epoch. The analytical Press-Schechter mass function and
its extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very useful
description of the growth of dark matter halos through hierarchical clustering,
and should providea valuable tool in studies of the formation and evolution of
galaxies and galaxy clusters.

spatial dimensions is discussed. The algorithm, which is described in detail,
is based on the integral form of Poisson's equation and utilizes spherical
coordinates and an expansion into spherical harmonics. The solver can be
applied to and works well for all problems for which the use of spherical
coordinates is appropriate. We also briefly discuss the implementation of the
algorithm into hydrodynamic codes which are based on a conservative
finite--difference scheme.

antisymmetric tensor $B_{\mu\nu}$, and $U(1)$ gauge field $A_{\mu}$ are
investigated. Both Boyer-Lindquist-like and Kerr-Schild-like coordinate are
constructed. The latter is utilised to construct the analytically extended
spacetime. The global structure of the resulting extended spacetime is almost
identical to that of the Kerr. In carrying out the analytic extension, the
radial coordinate should be suitably chosen so that we can avoid singularity
caused by the twisting. The thermodynamic property of the stringy black hole is
examined through the injection of test bodies into the black hole. It is shown
that one cannot change a black hole configuration into a naked singularity by
way of throwing test bodies into the black hole. The global $O(2,3)$ symmetry
and the preservation of the asymptotic flatness are discussed. When we impose
stationarity, axisymmetry, and asymptotic flatness, there is no other twisting
than the one pointed out by A.Sen\cite{sen}. All the other elements of $O(2,3)$
either break the asymptotic flatness, or cause only coordinate transformations
and gives no physical change.
