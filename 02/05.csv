that the mixed dark matter model, with $\ohdm = 0.3$, $\ocdm = 0.65$, $\obaryon

$z\simeq 3$ is too small to account for the total gaseous mass in DL systems,
even under the assumption that all the gas in collapsed halos has settled into
disks of neutral gas. The standard CDM model can account for the gas in DL
systems if the bias is $b\lsim 2$; the same is true for the CDM model with a
cosmological constant, if $b\lsim 1.5$ for $\Lambda = 0.8$. However, one still
needs to assume that a fraction $\gsim 0.4$ of the baryons in collapsed halos
at $z\simeq 3$ is in the form of neutral gas in disks. We also calculate the
column density distribution $f(\nhi)$ of the DL systems, in terms of the
surface density profiles of disks and the distribution of their central column
densities. It is shown that the form of $f(\nhi)$ at the high end of column
density is a diagnostic for the nature of DL systems.

Ly$\alpha$ absorption systems systems are the progenitors of present-day spiral
galaxies. We use the observed properties of these systems to place constraints
on the history of star formation in galactic disks, and on cosmological
theories of structure formation in the universe. We show that the observed
increase in $\Omega_{HI}$ contributed by damped Ly$\alpha$ systems at high
redshift implies that star formation must have been considerably less efficient
in the past. We also show that the data can constrain cosmological models in
which structure forms at late epochs. A mixed dark matter (MDM) model with
$\Omega_{\nu}=0.3$ is unable to reproduce the mass densities of cold gas seen
at high redshift, even in the absence of any star formation. We show that at
redshifts greater than 3, this model predicts that the total baryonic mass
contained in dark matter halos with circular velocities $V_c > 35$ km s$^{-1}$
is less than the observed mass of HI in damped systems. At these redshifts, the
photo-ionizing background would prevent gas from dissipating and collapsing to
form high column density systems in halos smaller than 35 km s$^{-1}$. MDM
models are thus ruled out by the observations.

simplification, and is also able to give a nice description of the backbending
phenomena, but has been challenged in a recent study about effective charges

infinite-period bifurcation which breaks the reflection symmetry of the
cellular array. Upon further decreasing $Le$ different kinds of periodically
modulated traveling waves (MTWs) as well as a branch of quasiperiodically
modulated traveling waves (QPMTWs) arise. These transitions are accompanied by
the development of different spatial and temporal symmetries including period
doublings and period halvings. We also observe the apparently chaotic temporal
behavior of a disordered cellular pattern involving creation and annihilation
of cells. We analytically describe the stability of the TW solution near its
onset+ using suitable phase-amplitude equations. Within this framework one of
the MTW's can be identified as a localized wave traveling through an underlying
