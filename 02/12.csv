exponentially during inflation in the new inflationary universe scenario.
Moreover, inflation of monopoles continues without an end even when inflation
ends in the surrounding space. Therefore primordial monopoles (as well as other
topological defects produced during inflation) can serve as seeds for the
process of eternal self-reproduction of inflationary universe.

the local magnetic order, such as Zn impurities or $Cu^{2+}$ vacancies, on the
low temperature properties of the cuprate superconductors. In the unitary
limit, at low temperatures, for a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state such
imperfections produce low energy quasiparticles with an anistropic spectrum in
the vicinity of the nodes. We find that for the $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ system, one
is in the {\em quasi-one-dimensional} regime of quasiparticle scattering,
discussed recently by Altshuler, Balatsky, and Rosengren, for impurity
concentrations in excess of $\sim 0.16\%$ whereas YBCO$_7$ appears likely to be
in the true 2D scattering regime for Zn concentrations less than $1.6\%$. We
show the neutron scattering results of Mason et al. \cite{Aeppli} on
$La_{1.86}Sr_{0.14}CuO_4$ provide strong evidence for ``dirty d-wave""
superconductivity in their samples. We obtain simple expressions for the
dynamic spin susceptibility and $^{63}Cu$ spin-lattice relaxation time,
$^{63}T_1$, in the superconducting state.

particle physics and cosmology. Inspired by the flat directions and the absence
of adjoint Higgs representations found in typical string models, we consider a
no-scale $SU(5)\times U(1)$ supergravity model. This model entails well
determined low-energy phenomenology, such as the value of the neutralino dark
matter relic abundance and a negative contribution to the vacuum energy. A
positive contribution to the vacuum energy is also typically present in string
theory as a consequence of the running of the fundamental constants towards
their fixed point values. If these two contributions cancel appropriately, one
may end up with a vacuum energy which brings many cosmological observations
into better agreement with theoretical expectations. The present abundance of
neutralinos would then be fixed. We delineate the regions of parameter space
allowed in this scenario, and study the ensuing predictions for the sparticle
and Higgs-boson masses in this model.

lattice computation of the effective potential for massless $\lambda\Phi^4$

results imply that the magnitude of the Higgs boson mass, beyond perturbation
theory, does not represent a measure of the observable interactions in the

O(N-1)$ - in a finite volume at finite temperature is considered. In the
framework of dimensional regularization, the partition function is calculated
to 3 loops for 3 and 4 dimensions, where Polyakov's measure for the functional
integration is applied. Although the underlying theory is the non-linear
$\sigma $ model, the 3 loop result turns out to be renormalizable in the sense
that all the singularities can be absorbed by the couplings occuring so far. In
finite volume, this property is highly non trivial and confirms the method for
the measure. We also show that the result coincides with the one obtained using
the Faddeev- Popov measure. This is also true for the maximal generalization of
Polyakov's measure: none of the additional invariant terms that can be added
contributes to the dimensionally regularized system. Our phenomenological
Lagrangian describes e.g. 2 flavor chiral QCD as well as the classical
Heisenberg model, but there are also points of contact with the Higgs model,
superconductors etc. Moreover the finite size corrections to the susceptibility
might improve the inerpretation of Monte Carlo results on the lattice.
