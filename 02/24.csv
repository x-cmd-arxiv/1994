text) for the initial conditions. The Zel'dovich approximation, with optimized
initial smoothing, worked extremely well. Its second-order generalization was
slightly better. The success of our best-choice was a result of the treatment
of the phases of nonlinear Fourier components. The adhesion approximation
produced the most accurate nonlinear power spectrum and density distribution,
but its phase errors suggest mass condensations were moved somewhat
incorrectly. Due to its better reproduction of the mass density distribution
function and power spectrum, adhesion might be preferred for some uses. We
recommend either n-body simulations or our modified versions of ZA, depending
on the purpose. Modified ZA can rapidly generate large numbers of realizations
of model universes with good accuracy down to galaxy group (or smaller) mass
scales.

be located at the minimum of the cluster gravitational potential. However, 32\%
(8 out of 25) of the clusters with more than 50 measured redshifts have central
galaxies with significant velocity offsets (with respect to other cluster
members). By studying their velocity distributions and correlations between
velocity and position, I show that the presence of a large peculiar velocity is
strongly correlated with the presence of substructure in these massive systems.
About 85\% (21 of 25) of all well-studied clusters show some evidence for
substructure, in contrast to the 30-40\% found when using only galaxy or gas
distributions. The correlation between substructure and central galaxy location
verifies the hypothesis of Merritt (1985) and Tremaine (1990) that high
peculiar velocities are indicative of recent merger events between less-massive
systems of galaxies. Dynamical friction should act quickly to pull the central
galaxy, the most massive discrete object in a cluster, to the minimum of the
potential. The less-massive galaxies retain information about their primordial
subclusters for a longer period of time. I use an objective partitioning
algorithm to assign cluster galaxies to their host subclumps. When galaxies are
allocated in this fashion to their subclusters, 75\% of the significant
velocity offsets are eliminated. Only 2 out of the 25 clusters have central
galaxies which are not centrally-located when substructure is considered in the

Edited by M. Sasaki) There are several models for generating fluctuations in an
open universe that are compatible with the microwave background fluctuations
detected by COBE {\it and} observations of large scale structure. Topological
defects, such as strings and textures, appear to be more successful in a
low-$\Omega$ model than in an $\Omega = 1$ model. These models predict that the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations are non-Gaussian with
distinctive signatures that may lead to their confirmation. If there exists a
mechanism for generating scale invariant mass fluctuations, $(\delta M/M)^2
\propto M^{-4/3}$, then these models are also compatible with COBE. Both models
predict mass fluctuations on the 8/h Mpc scale, $\sigma_8$, $\sim 0.5 - 1$ for
$\Omega h \sim 0.2 - 0.3$. A variety of observations of large-scale structure,
clusters and galaxies, as well as the age problem, suggest that the

(v=1 J=1-0 transition) in four known strong sources. These sources were
monitored nightly for a period of about a month. The aim of these observations
is to investigate the possible presence of variations in the maser lines on
time scales of a few days to weeks, due to sound waves propagating out from the
central star. If sound waves are responsible for the mass loss of certain cool
giants, as suggested by Pijpers and Hearn (1989) and Pijpers and Habing (1989),
local variations in density and relative velocity are expected just above the
stellar photosphere. These could give rise to variations in any narrow spectral
line formed in this region, and therefore in particular in the SiO maser lines.
Our observations indicate that variations in the line shape (leading to
relative changes in the intensity of about 20\%) occur in the SiO emission of
Mira type stars, within short time scales of 10-20 days. The main component of
the profile variability is consistent with a displacement of the velocity
centroid of the dominant maser peaks, by about 1 km s$^{-1}$ in the average.
Apparent variations in the total line flux were also found, but could be
partially due to calibration uncertainties.

scattering of straight strings, can be written in three different labeling
schemes: one can use as labels the states of the vacua between the strings, the
states of the string segments, or the states of the particles at the
intersections of the strings. We give a detailed derivation of the three
corresponding tetrahedron equations and show also how the Frenkel-Moore
equations fits in as a {\em nonlocal} string labeling. We discuss then how an
analog of the Wu-Kadanoff duality can be defined between each pair of the above
three labeling schemes. It turns out that there are two cases, for which one
can simultaneously construct a duality between {\em all} three pairs of
labelings.

A579 (1994) 85-102","10.1016/0375-9474(94)90795-1",,"nucl-th",,"  The momentum dependence of the mean-field contribution to the real part of
the optical model potential is investigated employing realistic nucleon-nucleon
interactions. Within a non-relativistic approach a momentum dependence
originates from the non-locality of the Fock exchange term. Deducing the real
part of the optical model from a relativistic Dirac Brueckner Hartree Fock
approximation for the self-energy of the nucleons yields an additional momentum
dependence originating from the non-relativistic reduction of the self-energy.
It is demonstrated that large Fock terms are required in the non-relativistic
approach to simulate these relativistic features. A comparison is made between
a local density approximation for the optical model and a direct evaluation in
finite nuclei.

  Approximation","17 pages, LaTeX, no figures","Phys.Rev.C49:2391-2397,1994","10.1103/PhysRevC.49.2391",,"nucl-th",,"  Expressions for the P,T-violating NN potentials are derived for $\pi$, $\rho$
and $\omega$ exchange. The nuclear matrix elements for $\rho$ and $\omega$
exchange are shown to be greatly suppressed, so that, under the assumption of
comparable coupling constants, $\pi$ exchange would dominate by two orders of
magnitude. The ratio of P,T-violating to P-violating matrix elements is found
to remain approximately constant across the nuclear mass table, thus
establishing the proportionality between time-reversal-violation and
parity-violation matrix elements. The calculated values of this ratio suggest a
need to obtain an accuracy of order $ 5 \times 10^{-4}$ for the ratio of the
PT-violating to P-violating asymmetries in neutron transmission experiments in
order to improve on the present limits on the isovector pion coupling constant.
