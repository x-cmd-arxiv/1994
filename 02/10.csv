group actions on algebraic varieties which in many cases appear as moduli
spaces parametrizing isomorphism classes of geometric objects (vector bundles,
polarized varieties, etc.). The quotient depends on a choice of an ample
linearized line bundle. Two choices are equivalent if they give rise to
identical quotients. A priori, there are infinitely many choices since there
are infinitely many isomorphism classes of linearized ample line bundles. Hence
several fundamental questions naturally arise. Is the set of equivalence
classes, and hence the set of non-isomorphic quotients, finite? How does the
quotient vary under change of the equivalence class? In this paper we give
partial answers to these questions in the case of actions of reductive
algebraic groups on nonsingular projective algebraic varieties. We shall show
that among ample line bundles which give projective geometric quotients there
are only finitely many equivalence classes. These classes span certain convex
subsets (chambers) in a certain convex cone in Euclidean space; and when we
cross a wall separating one chamber from another, the corresponding quotient
undergoes a birational transformation which is similar to a Mori flip.

Baade's Window towards the Galactic bulge with the OGLE project reveals a
surprisingly narrow main sequence due to galactic disk stars at a distance of
$d \sim 2 $ kpc, i.e. at the location of the Sagittarius spiral arm. A more
careful analysis indicates there is an excess in the number of disk stars by a
factor $\sim 2$ between us and $d \sim 2.5$ kpc and a rapid drop by a factor
$\sim 10$ beyond that distance. It is unlikely that the observed structure is
an artifact of the interstellar extinction, but careful determination of the
extinction is needed before the structure is firmly established. The narrow
main sequence extends down to stars as faint as $M_{_V} \approx 7$, i.e. it is
composed of old stars. This is not expected in a conventional disk model, or in
a conventional model of a spiral structure. However, a strong concentration of
old stars towards spiral arms has been noticed in some other galaxies, like M51
(Rix \& Rieke 1993), with the near infrared surface photometry. We have also
found that the relative distribution of red clump and red giant stars in the
Galactic bulge implies that there is a relatively young stellar population
present there.

of dark clusters which consist of small mass objects. Carr & Lacey (1987) have
derived the permissible properties of such systems, and proposed the existence
of dark clusters with mass of order $10^6\solarmass$ to explain some of the
observed dynamical properties of the stellar disk of the Galaxy. A population
of bound systems with mass of $\sim 10^5-10^6\solarmass$ is also an attractive
possibility since it is close to the baryon Jeans mass at recombination, which
may be the preferred mass scale for the first bound objects to form in the
universe. At the present, the existence of dark clusters which consist of brown
dwarfs, Jupiters, or black hole remnants of an early generation of stars, is
not indicated, nor can be excluded on observational grounds.
  We describe how dark clusters can be discovered in a sample of gravitational
microlensing events in LMC stars. Alternatively, it could provide strict bounds
on the fraction of halo mass which resides in such systems. If MACHOs are
clustered, the implied degeneracy in their spatial and velocity distributions
would result in a strong autocorrelation in the sky position of microlensing
events on an angular scale $\lesssim 20$ arcsec, along with a correlation in
the event duration.
  We argue that a small number of events could be enough to indicate the
existence of clusters, and demonstrate that a sample of $\simeq 10$ events
would be sufficient to reject the proposal of Carr & Lacey (1987) at the $95\%$
confidence level.

such discussions is a definition of ``quantum coherence''. In this article I
give a definition of quantum coherence and use a number of illustrations to
explore the implications of this definition. I point to topics of current
interest in the fields of cosmology and quantum computation where questions of
quantum coherence arise, and I emphasize the impact that interactions with the

over the whole region $0<x<1$ of the Bjorken variable. Our approach is based on
a relativistically covariant formalism which uses analytical properties of
quark correlators. In the laboratory frame it naturally incorporates two
mechanisms of DIS: (I) scattering from quarks and antiquarks in the target and
(II) production of quark-antiquark pairs followed by interactions with the
target. We first calculate structure functions of the free nucleon and develop
a model for the quark spectral functions. We show that mechanism (II) is
responsible for the sea quark content of the nucleon while mechanism (I)
governs the valence part of the nucleon structure functions. We find that the
coherent interaction of $\bar qq$ pairs with nucleons in the nucleus leads to
shadowing at small $x$ and discuss this effect in detail. In the large $x$
region DIS takes place mainly on a single nucleon. There we focus on the
derivation of the convolution model. We point out that the off-shell properties
of the bound nucleon structure function give rise to sizable nuclear effects.
