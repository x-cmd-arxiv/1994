X-ray luminosity and/or optical richness (1455+22; $z=0.26$, 0016+16; $z=0.55$
and 1603+43; $z=0.89$), we construct statistically-complete samples of faint
field galaxies ($I \leq 25$) suitable for probing the effects of gravitational
lensing. By selecting clusters across a wide redshift range we separate the
effects of the mean redshift distribution of the faint field population well
beyond spectroscopic limits and the distribution of dark matter in the lensing
clusters. A significant lensing signature is seen in the two lower redshift
clusters whose X-ray properties are well-constrained. Based on these and
dynamical data, it is straightforward to rule out field redshift distributions
for $I \leq 25$ which have a significant low redshift excess compared to the no
evolution prediction, such as would be expected if the number counts at faint
limits were dominated by low-$z$ dwarf systems. The degree to which we can
constrain any high redshift tail to the no evolution redshift distribution
depends on the distribution of dark matter in the most distant lensing cluster.
In the second paper in this series, we use the lensing signal to reconstruct
the full two-dimensional mass distribution in the clusters and, together with
high resolution X-ray images, demonstrate that their structural properties are
well-understood. The principal result is therefore the absence of a dominant
low-$z$ dwarf population to $I \leq25$.

those defined by the spatial distribution of colour-selected cluster members

the different cluster morphologies, one being cD-dominated and the other not,
in both cases the form of the mass distribution derived from the lensing signal

matter with respect to the galaxies. The overall similarity between the
distribution of total mass and that defined by the baryonic components presents
a significant new observational constraint on the nature of dark matter and the
evolutionary history of rich clusters.

spatial distribution of QSOs. Our method is based on the second derivative of
the two-point correlation function. This statistic is sensitive to the scale of
the maximum in the spectrum $P(k)$ of the density perturbation in the universe.
This maximum or bend scale can be detected as the wavelengths of the periodic
component in the second derivative of the integral correlation function. For
various QSO samples compiled from surveys of pencil-beam and bright QSOs, a
typical scale of about 93 $\pm$ 10 h$^{-1}$Mpc for $q_0=0.5$ has been detected.
This typical scale is in good agreement with that found in the spatial
distributions of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and CIV absorption systems of
QSOs if $q_0$ is taken to be $\sim 0.2$. Therefore, it is likely a common or
universal scale in the large scale structure traced by these objects. This
result is consistent with the assumption that the typical scale comes from a
characteristic scale in the spectrum of the density perturbation in the

changing a parameter measuring the correlation among adjacent layers, the
Hendricks- Teller superlattice exhibits a transition from periodic ordering,

many intermediate arrangements and the completely random case. In the partially

requires the existence of a delicate algebra of operators defined at a black
hole horizon. Operators describing ingoing particles are mapped onto operators
describing outgoing ones, preserving their commutator algebra. At short
distance, the transverse gravitational back reaction dictates a discrete
lattice of data points, and at large distance the algebra must reproduce known

phase transition. Within a random field domain the magnetization asymmetry of
the lepton antilepton plasma produced by a uniform constant magnetic field is
huge in contrast to their small density asymmetry, leading to a drastic change
in the active-sterile conversion rates. Assuming that the random field provides
the seed for the galactic field one can estimate the restrictions from
primordial nucleosynthesis. Requiring that the extra sterile \neu does not
enter in equilibrium with the active ones before nucleosynthesis we find limits
of the oscillation parameters which are stronger than in the isotropic case.

analytical methods and by computer simulations of stochastic processes in the
early Universe. We show that the global structure of the universe depends
crucially on the mechanism of inflation. In the simplest models of chaotic
inflation the Universe looks like a sea of thermalized phase surrounding
permanently self-reproducing inflationary domains. In the theories where
inflation occurs near a local extremum of the effective potential corresponding
to a metastable state, the Universe looks like de Sitter space surrounding
islands of thermalized phase. A similar picture appears even if the state $\phi
= 0$ is unstable but the effective potential has a discrete symmetry $\phi \to
=-\phi$. In this case the Universe becomes divided into domains containing
different phases. These domains will be separated from each other by domain
walls. However, unlike ordinary domain walls, these domain walls will inflate,
and their thickness will exponentially grow. In the theories with continuous
symmetries inflation generates exponentially expanding strings and monopoles
surrounded by thermalized phase. Inflating topological defects will be stable,
and they will unceasingly produce new inflating topological defects. This means
that topological defects may play a role of indestructible seeds for eternal
inflation.

orders in perturbation theory, it is shown that effects of virtual heavy
particles up to the order $1/M^{2N_0}$ can be systematically incorporated into
light-particle theory via effective local vertices of canonical dimension at
most $4+2N_0$. The couplings for vertices of dimension $4+2N$ are of order
$1/M^{2N}$ and are systematically calculable. All this is achieved through
intuitive dimensional arguments without resorting to complicated graphical
arguments or convergence theorems.
