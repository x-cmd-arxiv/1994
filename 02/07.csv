resolution H$\alpha$ spectra of the periodic radio star \lsi. The optical
photometric data set covers the time interval 1985-1993 and amounts to about a
hundred nights. A period of $\sim$26 days is found in the V band. The infrared
data also present evidence for a similar periodicity, but with higher amplitude
of variation (0\rmag 2). The spectroscopic observations include 16 intermediate
and high dispersion spectra of \lsi\ collected between January 1989 and
February 1993. The H$\alpha$ emission line profile and its variations are
analyzed. Several emission line parameters -- among them the H$\alpha$ EW and
the width of the H$\alpha$ red hump -- change strongly at or close to radio
maximum, and may exhibit periodic variability. We also observe a significant
change in the peak separation. The H$\alpha$ profile of \lsi\ does not seem
peculiar for a Be star. However, several of the observed variations of the
H$\alpha$ profile can probably be associated with the presence of the compact,
secondary star.

complex dynamical systems with special emphasis on ergodicity and chaos, and on
the semiclassical quantization of integrable and chaotic systems. The general
trace formula is discussed as a sound mathematical basis for the semiclassical
quantization of chaos. Two conjectures are presented on the basis of which it
is argued that there are unique fluctuation properties in quantum mechanics
which are universal and, in a well defined sense, maximally random if the
corresponding classical system is strongly chaotic. These properties constitute
the quantum mechanical analogue of the phenomenon of chaos in classical
mechanics. Thus quantum chaos has been found.

the weak-coupling regime. Infinite summation of certain classes of diagrams
turns out to be a quantitatively less accurate approximation than truncation of
the conserving approximations to a finite order, but the infinite summation

the transition temperature as the interaction strength increases.

many different spin models, however they fail for frustrated spin systems.
Recently a generalized cluster algorithm was introduced that works extremely
well for the fully frustrated Ising model on a square lattice, by placing bonds
between sites based on information from plaquettes rather than links of the
lattice. Here we study some properties of this algorithm and some variants of
it. We introduce a practical methodology for constructing a generalized cluster
algorithm for a given spin model, and investigate apply this method to some
other frustrated Ising models. We find that such algorithms work well for
simple fully frustrated Ising models in two dimensions, but appear to work
poorly or not at all for more complex models such as spin glasses.

conformal transformations of a spacetime is derived by using the formalism of
tangent bundles. The conformal invariance of the quantum corrected Vlasov
equation is proven. This provides a basis for generating new solutions of the
quantum kinetic equations in the presence of gravitational and other external
fields. We use our method to find explicit quantum corrections to the class of
locally isotropic distributions, to which equilibrium distributions belong. We
show that the quantum corrected stress--energy tensor for such distributions
has, in general, a non--equilibrium structure. Local thermal equilibrium is
possible in quantum systems only if an underlying spacetime is conformally
static (not stationary). Possible applications of our results are discussed.

constructions have appeared recently. They share the properties that the
Virasoro central charge is an integer equal to the dimension of the Lie algebra
and that they can be obtained by high-level contraction of reductive Sugawara
constructions: they thus correspond to free bosons. Exploiting a recent
structure theorem for Lie algebras with an invariant metric, we are able to
unify all the known constructions under the same formalism and, at the same
time, to prove several results about the Sugawara constructions. In particular,
we prove that all such constructions factorize into a standard (semisimple)
Sugawara construction and a nonsemisimple one (with integral central charge) of
a form which generalizes the nonsemisimple examples known so far.
