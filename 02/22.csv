and supply more robust methods that do not rely on such special characteristics
and hence naturally generalize to other dimensions. The moduli spaces for
Calabi--Yau $d$-folds are somewhat different from the ``special K\""ahler
manifolds'' which had occurred for $d=3$, and we indicate the new geometrical
structures which arise. We formulate and apply procedures which allow for the
construction of mirror maps and the calculation of order-by-order instanton
corrections to Yukawa couplings. Mathematically, these corrections are expected
to correspond to calculating Chern classes of various parameter spaces (Hilbert
schemes) for rational curves on Calabi--Yau manifolds. Our results agree with
those obtained by more traditional mathematical methods in the limited number
of cases for which the latter analysis can be carried out. Finally, we make
explicit some striking relations between instanton corrections for various
Yukawa couplings, derived from the associativity of the operator product
algebra.

target space metric of signature ($-,+,+,+$) by gauging the independent left
and right nilpotent subgroups with `null' generators of WZNW models for rank 2
non-compact groups $G$. The `null' property of the generators (${\rm Tr }(N_n
N_m)=0$) implies the consistency of the gauging and the absence of
$\a'$-corrections to the semiclassical backgrounds obtained from the gauged
WZNW models. In the case of the maximally non-compact groups ($G= SL(3),
SO(2,2), SO(2,3), G_2$) the construction corresponds to gauging some of the
subgroups generated by the nilpotent `step' operators in the Gauss
decomposition. The rank 2 case is a particular example of a general
construction leading to conformal backgrounds with one time-like direction. The
conformal theories obtained by integrating out the gauge field can be
considered as sigma model analogs of Toda models (their classical equations of
motion are equivalent to Toda model equations). The procedure of `null gauging'
applies also to other non-compact groups.
