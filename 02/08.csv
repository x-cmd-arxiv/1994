bundle $ E$ on $ P_{2n+1}$ with $c_2=k$ $h^1End( E) = 4(3n-1) k +

grows linearly in $k$. The main difference with the well known case of $ P_3$
is that $h^2End( E)$ is nonzero, in fact we prove that it grows quadratically
in $k$. Special symplectic instanton bundles turn out to be singular points of
the moduli space. Such bundles $ E$ are $SL(2)$--invariant and the result is
obtained regarding the cohomology groups of $ E$ as $SL(2)$--representations.

four phases in the phase diagram: two ordered phases in which the spins have a
N\'eel-type of long range order (an unreconstructed and a missing-row

(representing a rough surface), and an intermediate dimer phase which breaks
translational invariance and has a doubly degenerate ground state,
corresponding to a disordered flat surface. The transition from the $(2\times

Though the classical solutions are singular, and the wave functions have no

regular. For a quasi-classical (coherent) state, the metric expectation value
describes a universe (or star) that collapses to a minimum radius, the Planck
radius, and re-expands again.

rather than the usual bosonic or Grassmann ones. We show that the definite
integral $\int x$ can also be evaluated algebraically as multiples of the
integral of a $q$-Gaussian, with $x$ remaining as a bosonic scaling variable
associated with the $q$-deformation. Further composing our algebraic
integration with a representation then leads to ordinary numbers for the
integral. We also use our integration to develop a full theory of $q$-Fourier
transformation $F$. We use the braided addition $\Delta x=x\otimes 1+1\otimes
x$ and braided-antipode $S$ to define a convolution product, and prove a
convolution theorem. We prove also that $F^2=S$. We prove the analogous results
on any braided group, including integration and Fourier transformation on
quantum planes associated to general R-matrices, including $q$-Euclidean and
$q$-Minkowski spaces.
