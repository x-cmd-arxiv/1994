The absence of non-resistive terms in Ohm's law and the natural substitution of
the 4-velocity for the velocity flux in the relativistic bulk plasma equations
do not require the field gradient length scale to be much larger than the
lepton inertial lengths, or the existence of a frame in which the distribution
functions are isotropic.

glasses at low temperatures are strong aging effects. These phenomena can be
manipulated by changing the external parameters in various ways: a
thermo-cycling experiment consists for instance of a short heat pulse during
the waiting time, by which the relaxation might be strongly affected. Results
of numerical experiments of this kind, performed via Monte Carlo simulations of
the three dimensional Ising spin glass model, are presented. The theoretical
implications are discussed and the scenario found is compared with the
experimental situation.

quarks are unobservable one can suggest different definitions of $m_Q$. One of
the most popular choices is the pole quark mass routinely used in perturbative
calculations and in some analyses based on heavy quark expansions. We show that
no precise definition of the pole mass can be given in the full theory once
non-perturbative effects are included. Any definition of this quantity suffers
from an intrinsic uncertainty of order $\Lam /m_Q$. This fact is succinctly
described by the existence of an infrared renormalon generating a factorial
divergence in the high-order coefficients of the $\alpha_s$ series; the
corresponding singularity in the Borel plane is situated at $2\pi /b$. A
peculiar feature is that this renormalon is not associated with the matrix
element of a local operator. The difference $\La \equiv M_{H_Q}-m_Q^{pole}$ can
still be defined in Heavy Quark Effective Theory, but only at the price of
introducing an explicit dependence on a normalization point $\mu$: $\La (\mu
)$. Fortunately the pole mass $m_Q(0)$ {\em per se} does not appear in
calculable observable quantities.

The Slavnov-Taylor identity is used to construct the three-gluon vertex
function from the inverse gluon propagator. After solving the Schwinger - Dyson
equation beyond leading order we find that the obtained momentum dependence of
the gluon self-energy at high temperature does not correspond to an attractive
QCD - Debye potential, but instead it is repulsive and power behaved ($ \simeq
1/r^6$) at large distance.

Especially the elliptic genera are computed in general and, for a class of
models recently invented by Distler and Kachru, they are compared with the ones
from (0,2) sigma models. Our formalism gives an easy way to calculate the
generation numbers for lots of Distler-Kachru models even if they are based on
singular Calabi-Yau spaces. We also make some general remarks on the
Born-Oppenheimer calculation of the ground states elucidating its mathematical
meaning in the untwisted sector. For Distler-Kachru models based on
non-singular Calabi-Yau spaces we show that there exist `residue' type formulas
of the elliptic genera as well.
