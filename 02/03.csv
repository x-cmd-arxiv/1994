planes. Recently A.Verra proved that the existence of two conic bundle
structures (c.b.s.) on T implies a new counterexample to the Torelli theorem
for Prym varieties. Let J(T) be the jacobian of T. In this paper we prove that
any of the two c.b.s. on T admits a parametrisation of the theta divisor of
J(T) by the Abel-Jacobi image of a special family of elliptic curves of degree
9 (minimal sections of the given c.b.s.) on T. This result is an analogue of
the well-known Riemann theorem for curves. In particular, this implies some
results about K3 surfaces and plane sextics with vanishing theta-null. Further
we use once again the geometry of curves on T, in order to prove the Torelli
theorem for the bidegree (2,2) threefolds.

secular perturbation of a second, more distant companion. Such a triple
configuration has been proposed recently as the most likely cause of the
anomalous second period derivative of the pulsar. The current timing data are
consistent with a second companion mass $m_2$ as low as $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$,
i.e., comparable to that of Jupiter. However, {\em if\/} the eccentricity is
indeed produced by secular perturbations, then the second companion must be
another star, most likely of mass $m_2\lo1M_\odot$ and in a very eccentric
($e_2\go0.5$) orbit of period $P_2\sim10^2$--$10^3\,$yr. A second companion of
planetary mass cannot induce the observed eccentricity. Independent of the mass
of the second companion, small changes in the binary pulsar's orbit should
become detectable with just a few additional years of timing data. This
detection would provide direct confirmation of the triple nature of the system,
and an accurate measurement of the effects would place important new
constraints on the orbital parameters.

and do not have any associated length scale, therefore the dark halos of
galaxies should have negligible core radii. This expectation has been supported
by numerical experiments of collisionless particles within scale free and cold
dark matter cosmologies. Most dwarf spiral galaxies are almost completely dark
matter dominated, allowing a unique insight into their mass - density profiles
which can be approximated by isothermal spheres with core radii of order 3 - 7
kpc. We can therefore make a direct comparison between these galaxies, and
halos which form within the numerical simulations. This yields a severe
discrepancy in that the simulations predict the density to fall as rho(r)
\propto r^{-1} on the scales where the data show that rho(r) = const: e.g. the
models overestimate the mass within the central few kpc of the halos by a
factor of four. The formation of the luminous component of galaxies exacerbates
this disparity between theory and observations, since the contraction of the
baryons can significantly increase the central dark matter density.

to find the appropriate spinor propagation laws to the Nester--Witten integral,
all the possible first order linear differential operators that can be
constructed only from the irreducible chiral parts of the Sen operator alone
are determined and examined. It is only the holomorphy or anti-holomorphy
operator that can define acceptable propagation laws. The 2 dimensional Sen
connection thus naturally defines a quasi-local energy-momentum, which is
precisely that of Dougan and Mason. Then provided the dominant energy condition
holds and the 2-sphere S is convex we show that the next statements are
equivalent: i. the quasi-local mass (energy-momentum) associated with S is
zero; ii.the Cauchy development $D(\Sigma)$ is a pp-wave geometry with pure
radiation ($D(\Sigma)$ is flat), where $\Sigma$ is a spacelike hypersurface
whose boundary is S; iii. there exist a Sen--constant spinor field (two spinor
fields) on S. Thus the pp-wave Cauchy developments can be characterized by the
geometry of a two rather than a three dimensional submanifold.

renormalisation. The reason for the difference is traced to the different

successfully describes the non--linear stage of evolution of perturbations (see
[1], [2] and references therein). This model predicts DM density distribution
$\rho(r) \sim r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \simeq 1.8$ which holds from very small
distances $r_{\rm min} \simeq 0.01~{\rm pc}$ up to very large distances $r_{\rm
max} \simeq 5~{\rm Mpc}$. Assuming the neutralino to be a CDM particle, we
calculate the annihilation of neutralinos in the vicinity of the singularity
(Galactic Center). If neutralinos are the dominant component of DM in our
Galaxy, the produced energy is enough to provide the whole observed activity of
the GC. Neutralinos of the most general composition and of mass in the range
$20~{\rm GeV} \leq m_\c \leq 1~{\rm TeV}$ are considered. We find the
neutralino compositions which give the relic density needed for the Mixed Dark
Matter (MDM) model and we evaluate for these compositions the high--energy
($E_{\gamma} > 100 ~{\rm MeV}$) gamma--ray flux under the constraint that the
radio flux is lower than the observational limit. The compositions with the
detectable gamma--ray flux which we found are provided by a set of almost pure
gaugino states with the neutralino mass between $100$ and $500$ GeV. We
demonstrate that a detectable high--energy gamma--ray flux is produced by the
neutralino annihilation also in the case when neutralinos provide a small
fraction (down to $0.1 \%$) of the DM in our Galaxy. The predicted flux is
$F_\gamma \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-8}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ for $E_\gamma \gsim
300~{\rm MeV}$

violate covariance and cluster decomposition, and allow functions of
longitudinal momenta to appear in all relevant, marginal, and irrelevant
operators. These functions can be determined by insisting that the Hamiltonian
display a coupling constant coherence, with the number of couplings that
explicitly run with the cutoff scale being limited and all other couplings
depending on this scale only through perturbative dependence on the running
couplings. Examples are given that show how coupling coherence restores Lorentz

ill-definedness can be overcome and several applications in other fields like
biology, chemistry or optics have already shown its feasability. Moreover, the
method also promises to deliver upper bounds on the total information content

Here we compute several Laplace inversions from different thermal scenarios,
both analytically and numerically, to test the efficiency of the method.
Especially the case of a two component structure, related to a possible first
order phase transition to a quark gluon plasma, is closer investigated and it
