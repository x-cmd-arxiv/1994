bursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased smoothly with
redshift, from about 8\% at $z\approx1$ to less than 1\% at $z\approx0$. This
result, which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers, is
nearly independent of the assumed ages and morphological types of the
progenitor galaxies prior to the last major bursts of star formation. We then
compute the implied color and 4000 {\AA} break evolution for progenitors of
E/S0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts $0\simlt z\simlt1$. We investigate a
conservative model in which all present-day E/S0 galaxies are assumed to
initially be elliptical galaxies and to then undergo bursts of star formation
at the rate estimated from the signatures of intermediate-age stars at low
redshifts. This model reproduces well the observed spread of colors and 4000
{\AA} breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters, but underestimates the
fraction of galaxies in the blue tail of the distribution. Such a discrepancy
may be interpreted as an increasing fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at
high redshift, as suggested independently by recent {\it HST} observations of
intermediate-redshift clusters. The current data do not seem to require
morphological evolution of cluster galaxies out to $z\sim0.4$, but suggest that
either morphological or strong luminosity evolution might have played a major
role at $z\simgt0.7$.

Ly-a absorption system, with neutral hydrogen column density of
logN(HI)=20.2+/-0.4, and it is the cause of the Lyman limit break at 3520\AA.
The metal abundance in the gas phase of the system is [M/H]=-2.6+/-0.3, with a
best estimate of [M/H]= -2.8, with ionization parameter Gamma=-2.75, from a
photoionization model. We show that the abundance ratios rule out appreciable
dust in this DLA system. We do not see the enhancement of O over C reported in
Nature by Reimers last years. We see CII*(1335) offset by 15 km/s with respect
to CII(1334), presumably because the gas density varies from 2 - 8 cm(-3) with
changing velocity in the DLA system. These densities imply that the damped
component is 6 - 25 pc thick, which is reasonable for a single cloud in a cold

the coefficient of the dominant exchange coupling of the magnetic impurity with
the nearest lattice site. When the system is hole doped, there is also an
antiferromagnetic coupling to the nearest neighbors of that site involving
additionally a hole. Furthermore, it is found that the magnetic impurity

frequencies in odd proton rare earth nuclei is given. As an example, the proton
${1\over 2} [541]$ band in $^{175}$Ta is discussed in detail by using the
angular momentum projection theory. It is shown that the quadrupole pairing
interaction is decisive in delaying the crossing point and the changes in
crossing frequency along the isotope chain are due to the different neutron
shell fillings.
