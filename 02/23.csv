Miras. Interferometric spectral-line observations of R Aqr and H1-36 Arae have
revealed a 22-GHz water maser in the former and 1612-MHz hydroxyl and weak
22-GHz water maser emission from the latter. H1-36 has thus become the first
known symbiotic OH/IR star. We have also detected weak OH line emission from
the vicinity of R Aqr, but we note that there are small discrepencies between
the OH- and H2O-line velocities and positions. These detections demonstrate
unequivocally that dust can shield some circumstellar hydroxyl and water
molecules from dissociation, even in systems which possess intense local
sources of UV. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of these
observations. The narrow profile of the water maser in R Aqr means that there
may finally be an opportunity to determine the system's orbital parameters. We
also point out that high resolution synthesis observations may trace the
distribution of dust in H1-36 and R Aqr, possibly throwing light on the
mass-loss process in symbiotic Miras and placing constraints on the amount of
collimation experienced by UV radiation from their hot, compact companions.

  Toronto pre-print; ERSRJI3",,"10.1093/mnras/269.2.512",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent maser surveys have shown that many potential OH/IR stars have no OH
masers in their circumstellar envelopes, despite the modest requirements which
should be implicitly met by IRAS colour-selected candidates. It has been
suggested that these OH/IR colour mimics must have a degenerate companion which
dissociates OH molecules and disrupts the masing action, ie. that they are
related to symbiotic Miras. Coincidentally, there is a paucity of long-period
symbiotic Miras and symbiotic OH/IR stars. Phenomonologically, those that are
known seem to cluster in the zone where field Miras transform into OH/IR stars.
If it could be proven that OH/IR colour mimics contain a degenerate star, that
observable evidence of this star is hidden from view by CS dust whilst it
slowly accretes from the wind of its Mira companion, then we have an excellent
explanation for not only the existence of OH/IR colour mimics, but also for the
low observed frequency of symbiotic OH/IR stars and the common occurrence of
very slow novae in long-period symbiotic Miras. Here, we employ radio continuum
radiation (which should escape unhindered from within the dust shells) as a
simple probe of the postulated hot degenerate companions which would inevitably
ionize a region of their surrounding gas. We compare the radio and infrared
properties of the colour mimics with those of normal symbiotic Miras, using the
strong correlation between radio and mid-IR emission in symbiotic stars. We
show that if a hot companion exists then, unlike their symbiotic counterparts,
they must produce radiation-bounded nebulae. Our observations provide no
support for the above scenario for the lack of observed masers, but neither do
they permit a rejection of this scenario.

with maximal frustration in a square lattice. We use extensive Monte Carlo
simulations to study the thermodynamics of the spin and chiral degrees of
freedom, concentrating on their correlation functions. The gauge invariant
spin-spin correlation functions are calculated close to the critical point for
lattice sizes up to $240\times 240$; the chiral correlation functions are
studied on lattices up to $96\times 96$. We find that the critical exponents of
the spin phase transition are $\nu=0.3069$, and $\eta=0.1915$, which are to be
compared with the unfrustrated XY model exponents $\nu=1/2$ and $\eta=0.25$. We
also find that the critical exponents of the chiral transition are
$\nu_{\chi}=0.875$, $2\beta=0.1936$, $2\gamma= 1.82$, and
$2\gamma\>\prime=1.025$, which are different from the expected 2-D Ising
critical exponents. The spin-phase transition occurs at $T_{U(1)}=0.446$ which
is about 7\% above the estimated chiral critical temperature $T_{Z_{2}}=
0.4206$. However, because of the size of the statistical errors, it is
difficult to decide with certainty whether the transitions occur at the same or
at slightly different temperatures. Finally, the jump in the helicity modulus
in the fully frustrated system is found to be about 23\% below the unfrustrated
universal value. The most important consequence of these results is that the
fully frustrated XY model appears to be in a novel universality class. Recent
successful comparisons of some of these results with experimental data are also
briefly discussed. (TO APPEAR IN PRB)
