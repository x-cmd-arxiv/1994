produces an inflationary era. A phase transition to a radiation--dominated era
occurs as a consequence of boundary conditions expressing the assumption that
the temperature cannot exceed the Planck value. We find that over a broad range
of initial conditions, the predicted value of the Hubble parameter is
approximately $47$ km$\cdot$~s$^{-1}\cdot$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Inflation is driven by a
scalar field, which must be conformally coupled to the curvature if the
Einstein equivalence principle has to be satisfied. The form of the scalar
field potential is derived, instead of being assumed a priori.

relatively high resolution of the spectrum ($\sim 40$ km s$^{-1}$) allows the
selection of regions free of strong absorption lines in the Lyman alpha forest.
A reliable evaluation of the continuum shape is based on the careful flux
calibration and on the large wavelength interval covered (5000--9300 ~\AA). A
best estimate of $\tau _{_{GP}}\leq 0.02\pm 0.03$ has been found for the
Gunn-Peterson optical depth at the highest absorption redshift observed at this
resolution, $z \simeq 4.3$. The derived baryon density of the intergalactic
medium is $\Omega _{IGM}\mincir 0.01$ if the observed quasars are the major
contributor to the ionizing UV background flux. This limit, when compared with
the total baryon density deduced from the nucleosynthesis, could imply that
most of the baryons are already in bound systems at $z\sim 5$.

t->infinity, and generalize the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to show that their
reduced Wigner distributions become Gaussian under quite general conditions.
This shows that generalized coherent states tend to be produced naturally. A
sufficient condition for this to happen is shown to be that the spectral
function is analytic and nonlinear. For a rectangular lattice of coupled
oscillators, the nonlinearity requirement means that waves must be dispersive,
so that localized wave-packets become suppressed. Virtually all harmonic
heat-bath models in the literature satisfy this constraint, and we have good
reason to believe that coherent states and their generalizations are not merely
a useful analytical tool, but that nature is indeed full of them. Standard
proofs of the CLT rely heavily on the fact that probability densities are
non-negative. Although the CLT generally fails if the probability densities are
allowed to take negative values, we show that a CLT does indeed hold for a
special class of such functions. We find that, intriguingly, nature has
arranged things so that all Wigner functions belong to this class.

couplings from a theoretical and from a purely phenomenological point of view.
Due to their small magnitude $b$ decay couplings are subject to possible large
corrections from right-handed terms, on the one hand, and do not affect the
weak interactions of the first two quark families in any observable manner, on
the other hand. This motivated an $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)$ model with
purely right-handed $b$-decay couplings. The model is consistent with
experiments, including recent measurements of a lepton forward-backward
asymmetry in $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ and of radiative $B$ decays. Parity violating
asymmetries in semileptonic decays of polarized $\Lambda_b$ baryons produced in
$Z^0$ decays provide a promising way of measuring the chirality of the $b$ to
$c$ current.
