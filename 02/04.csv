duality satisfies by these cones corresponds to the mirror involution. Using
the theory of toric varieties, we show that our conjecture includes as special

to the gas pressure with the viscosity parameter formulated as $\alpha

$r$ is the distance from the central compact object, and $n$, $\alpha_0$ and
$\alpha_{\max}$ are constants. It is found that the disk is unstable for
$\alpha$ sufficiently sensitive to $h$ ($n \gapprox 1.2$). The instabilities
are globally coherent in the entire unstable region of the disk and, depending
on the viscosity parameters, the time variability of the mass accretion rates
are manifested as periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations. We show that, the
low frequency ($\sim 0.04$~Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) discovered
recently in some of the black hole candidates (Cyg~X-1 and GRO~J0422+32) and a
low mass X-ray binary (Rapid Burster MXB~1730--335) may be explicable by the

place constraints on the viscosity parameters and suggest that $(n,\alpha_0)$
$\sim (1.6,30)$ for the Rapid Burster with a $1.4\,\msun$ neutron star. In the
case of black hole candidates, the dependence of $\alpha$ on $h/r$ is less
steep corresponding to $n \sim 1.2-1.3$ for black holes less than $10\,\msun$.

generically given by $\lambda_t={\cal O}(g)$, with $g$ the unified gauge
coupling. A detailed study of the Yukawa sector of $SU(5)\times U(1)$
supergravity shows that the ratio of the bottom-quark to tau-lepton Yukawa
couplings at the string scale is required to be in the range
$0.7\lsim\lambda_b/\lambda_\tau\lsim1$, depending on the values of $m_t$ and
$m_b$. This result is consistent with $SU(5)\times U(1)$ symmetry, which does
{\em not} require the equality of these Yukawa couplings in the unbroken

change of background gauge field together with the gauge transformation on a
circle. Applied to the boundary circle of a disc with field insertion, such a
realization leads to a certain relation among correlators of the gauged WZW
model for various principal $H$-bundles. In the course of derivation, we find
an expression of a (dressed) gauge invariant field as an integral over the flag
manifold of $H$ and an expression of a correlator as an integral over a certain
moduli space of holomorphic $H_{\bf
  C}$-bundles with quasi-flag structure at the insertion point. We also find
that the gauge transformation on the circle corresponding to the spectral flow
determines a bijection of the set of isomorphism classes of holomorphic $H_{\bf
C}$-bundles with quasi-flag structure of one topological type to that of
another. As an application, it is pointed out that problems arising from the
field identification fixed points may be resolved by taking into account of all
principal $H$-bundles.

soliton model. Here, the long-range parts of the nonabelian gluon
self-interactions are assumed to give rise to a color-dielectric function which
is parameterized in terms of an effective scalar background field. The
six-quark system is confined in a deformed mean field through an effective
non-linear interaction between the quarks and the scalar field. The CDM is
covariant, respects chiral invariance, leads to absolute color confinement and
is free of the spurious long range Van der Waals forces which trouble
non-relativistic investigations employing a confining potential. Six-quark
molecular-type configurations are generated as a function of deformation and
their energies are evaluated in a coupled channel analysis. By using molecular
states instead of cluster model wave functions, all important six-quark
configurations are properly taken into account. The corresponding Hamiltonian
includes the effective interaction between the quarks and the scalar background
field and quark-quark interactions generated through one gluon exchange treated
in Coulomb gauge. When evaluating the gluonic propagators, the inhomogeneity
and deformation of the dielectric medium are taken into account. Results for
the adiabatic nucleon-nucleon potential are presented, and the various
contributions are discussed. Finally, an outlook is given on how, in the next
stage of our investigation, the dynamical effects will be incorporated by
employing the generator coordinate method.

a field theory with a three-point interaction vertex. These equations describe
the coupled 2->2, 2->3, and 3->3 processes, and provide the means of
calculating the kernel of the 2->2 Bethe-Salpeter equation. Our equations
differ from all previous formulations in two essential ways. Firstly, we have
overcome the overcounting problems inherent in earlier works. Secondly, we have
retained all possible two-body forces when one particle is a spectator. In this
respect, we show how it is necessary to also retain certain three-body forces
as these can give rise to (previously overlooked) two-body forces when used in
a 2->3 process. The revealing of such hidden two-body forces gives rise to a
further novel feature of our equations, namely, to the appearance of a number
of subtraction terms. In the case of the piNN system, for example, the NN
potential involves a subtraction term where two pions, exchanged between the
nucleons, interact with each other through the pi-pi t-matrix. The necessity of
an input pi-pi interaction is surprising and contrasts markedly with the
corresponding three-dimensional description of the piNN system where no such
interaction explicitly appears. This illustrates the somewhat unexpected result
that the four-dimensional equations differ from the three-dimensional ones even
at the operator level.

obtained at the price of having to use an effective piNN coupling constant that
is smaller than the experimental one. This is but one aspect of a more general
renormalization problem whose origin lies in the truncation of Hilbert space
used to derive the equations. Here we present a new theoretical approach to the
piNN problem where unitary equations are obtained without having to truncate
Hilbert space. Indeed, the only approximation made is the neglect of connected
three-body forces. As all possible dressings of one-particle propagators and
vertices are retained in our model, we overcome the renormalization problems
inherent in previous piNN theories. The key element of our derivation is the
use of convolution integrals that have enabled us to sum all the possible
disconnected time-ordered graphs. We also discuss how the convolution method
can be extended to sum all the time orderings of a connected graph. This has
enabled us to calculate the fully dressed NN one pion exchange potential. We
show how such a calculation can be used to estimate the size of the connected
three-body forces neglected in the new piNN equations. Early indications are
that such forces may be negligible.
