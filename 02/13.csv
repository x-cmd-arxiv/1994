  PostScript. Lick Preprint Number 18",,"10.1086/174542",,"astro-ph",,"  The Sachs-Wolfe effect is known to produce large angular scale fluctuations
in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) due to gravitational
potential fluctuations. We show how the angular correlation function of the
CMBR can be expressed explicitly in terms of the mass autocorrelation function
$\xi (r)$ in the Universe. We derive analytic expressions for the angular
correlation function and its multipole moments in terms of integrals over $\xi
(r)$ or its second moment, $J_3 (r)$, which does not need to satisfy the sort
of integral constraint that $\xi (r)$ must. We derive similar expressions for
bulk flow velocity in terms of $\xi$ and $J_3$. One interesting result that
emerges directly from this analysis is that, for angles $\theta$, there is a
substantial contribution to the correlation function from a wide range of
distance $r$ and that the radial shape of this contribution does not vary
greatly with angle.

model on two-dimensional Poissonian random lattices with up to 80,000 sites
which are linked together according to the Voronoi/Delaunay prescription. In
one set of simulations we use reweighting techniques and finite-size scaling
analysis to investigate the critical properties of the model in the very
vicinity of the phase transition. In the other set of simulations we study the
approach to criticality in the disordered phase, making use of improved
estimators for measurements. From both sets of simulations we obtain clear
evidence that the critical exponents agree with the exactly known exponents for
regular lattices, i.e., that (lattice) universality holds for the
two-dimensional Ising model.

develop the idea of Banks and Zaks to expand about N_f=16\half. This expansion
is certainly useful for N_f=16, 15, 14, ..., and arguably it can reach the
phenomenologically interesting case N_f=2, where it suggests that alpha_s/pi
""freezes"" to a value of order of magnitude 0.4 in the infrared.
