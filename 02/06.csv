transition in $d>2$ dimensions to be universal and drastically different from
both Wigner-Dyson in the metallic regime and Poisson in the insulator regime.
The variance of the number of levels $N$ in a given energy interval with
$\langle N\rangle\gg1$ is proved to behave as $\langle N\rangle^\gamma$ where
$\gamma=1-(\nu d)^{-1}$ and $\nu$ is the correlation length exponent. The
inequality $\gamma<1$, shown to be required by an exact sum rule, results from
nontrivial cancellations (due to the causality and scaling requirements) in
calculating the two-level correlation function.

"cond-mat/9402027",,"A. G. Aronov, V. E. Kravtsov, I. V. Lerner","The Level Spacing Distribution Near the Anderson Transition","REVTeX, 8 pages, no figures",,,,"cond-mat",,"  For a disordered system near the Anderson transition we show that the
nearest-level-spacing distribution has the asymptotics $P(s)\propto \exp(-A
s^{2-\gamma })$ for $s\gg \av{s}\equiv 1$ which is universal and intermediate
between the Gaussian asymptotics in a metal and the Poisson in an insulator.
(Here the critical exponent $0<\gamma<1$ and the numerical coefficient $A$
depend only on the dimensionality $d>2$). It is obtained by mapping the energy
level distribution to the Gibbs distribution for a classical one-dimensional
gas with a pairwise interaction. The interaction, consistent with the universal
asymptotics of the two-level correlation function found previously, is proved
to be the power-law repulsion with the exponent $-\gamma$.

"cond-mat/9402028",,"I.V. Lerner","Distributions of the Diffusion Coefficient for the Quantum and Classical
  Diffusion in Disordered Media","REVTeX, 20 pages, no figures",,,,"cond-mat",,"  It is shown that the distribution functions of the diffusion coefficient are
very similar in the standard model of quantum diffusion in a disordered metal
and in a model of classical diffusion in a disordered medium: in both cases the
distribution functions have lognormal tails, their part increasing with the
increase of the disorder. The similarity is based on a similar behaviour of the
high-gradient operators determining the high-order cumulants. The one-loop
renormalization-group corrections make the anomalous dimension of the operator
that governs the $s$-th cumulant proportional to $s(s-1)$ thus overtaking for
large $s$ the negative normal dimension. As behaviour of the ensemble-averaged
diffusion coefficient is quite different in these models, it suggests that a
possible universality in the distribution functions is independent of the
behaviour of average quantities.
