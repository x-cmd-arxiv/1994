  in the directory pub/dynamics as training.ps",,,,"adap-org chao-dyn nlin.AO nlin.CD",,"  We present a two-level model of organizational training and agent production.
Managers decide whether or not to train based on both the costs of training
compared to the benefits and on their expectations and observations of the
number of other firms that also train. Managers also take into account the sum
of their employees' contributions and the average tenure length within their
organization. Employees decide whether or not to contribute to production based
on their expectations as to how other employees will act. Trained workers learn
over time and fold their increased productivity into their decision whether or
not to contribute. We find that the dynamical behavior at the two levels is
closely coupled: the evolution of the industry over time depends not only on
the characteristics of training programs, learning curves, and cost-benefit
analyses, but on the vagaries of chance as well. For example, in one case, the
double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity
then increases steadily over time. In another, the organizational level dilemma
may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In this
case the overall productivity stays low. We also find a correlation between
high productivity and low turnover and show that a small increase in training
rates can lead to explosive growth in productivity.

lepton and the bottom and top quark Yukawa couplings unify at the grand
unification scale. The condition of Yukawa unification leads naturally to large

out. Alternatively, new massless states appear there. These may be the
elementary massless particles or new massless bound states.

Representations of the infinite dimensional extended reflection equation
algebra in terms of direct products of quantum algebra generators are derived,
they lead to a representation of this braid group in terms of $R$-matrices.
Restriction to the reflection equation operators only gives the coloured braid
group. The reflection equation operators, describing the effect of handles
attached to a 3-ball, satisfy characteristic equations which give rise to
additional skein relations and thereby invariants of links on handlebodies. The
origin of the skein relations is explained and they are derived from an
adequately adapted handlebody version of the Jones polynomial. Relevance of
these results to the construction of link polynomials on closed 3-manifolds via
Heegard splitting and surgery is indicated.

the basis of certain universality assumptions we argue that at critical points
with diverging string susceptibility the model either exhibits mean field
behaviour or it can effectively be described by a conformal matter system with
central charge less than or equal to 1 coupled to 2d gravity. As a particular
consequence we conclude in the unitary case that the string susceptibility
exponent is limited to possible values of the form 1/n, n=2,3,4,..., where n=2
