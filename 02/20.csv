series is introduced. Non-deterministic dynamics may arise due to the failure
of the Lipschitz condition in the equations of motion. At a singular point, the
phase space trajectory of the system may jump from one solution to another.
This discontinous change implies divergence of the second derivative of the
solution whenever it passes near the singular point. A time series can be
examined for such divergences, which may indicate non-determinism in the
dynamical system. Examples with both simulated and actual data are given.

this spirit we study the approximations of continuous spaces by graphs,
molecular spaces and coordinate matrices. We define the dimension on a discrete
space by means of axioms, and the axioms are based on an obvious geometrical
background. This work presents some discrete models of n-dimensional Euclidean
spaces, n-dimensional spheres, a torus and a projective plane. It explains how
to construct new discrete spaces and describes in this connection several
three-dimensional closed surfaces with some topological singularities
  It also analyzes the topology of (3+1)-spacetime. We are also discussing the
question by R. Sorkin [19] about how to derive the system of simplicial
complexes from a system of open covering of a topological space S.

Landau--Ginzburg models, we show that the Berglund--H""ubsch construction works
for all potentials of the relevant type. The map that sends a monomial in the
original model to a twisted state in the orbifold representation of the mirror
is constructed explicitly. Via this map, the OP selection rules of the chiral
ring exactly correspond to the twist selection rules for the orbifold. This
shows that we indeed arrive at the correct point in moduli space, and that the
mirror map can be extended to arbitrary orbifolds, including non-abelian twists
and discrete torsion, by modding out the appropriate quantum symmetries.
