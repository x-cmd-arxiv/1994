map from a manifold $M$ to a compact group $G$, is it possible to smoothly
`diagonalize' it, i.e.~conjugate it into a map to a maximal torus $T$ of $G$?
We analyze the local and global obstructions and give a complete solution to
the problem for regular maps. We establish that these can always be smoothly
diagonalized locally and that the obstructions to doing this globally are
non-trivial Weyl group and torus bundles on $M$. We show how the patching of
local diagonalizing maps gives rise to non-trivial $T$-bundles, explain the
relation to winding numbers of maps into $G/T$ and restrictions of the
structure group and examine the behaviour of gauge fields under this
diagonalization. We also discuss the complications that arise for non-regular
maps and in the presence of non-trivial $G$-bundles. In particular, we
establish a relation between the existence of regular sections of a non-trivial
adjoint bundle and restrictions of the structure group of a principal
$G$-bundle to $T$. We use these results to justify a Weyl integral formula for
functional integrals which, as a novel feature not seen in the
finite-dimensional case, contains a summation over all those topological
$T$-sectors which arise as restrictions of a trivial principal $G$ bundle and

carried out in three different ways. In the three approaches the supermomentum
constraint is solved at the classical level but they differ in the way the
hamiltonian constraint is imposed. We compare these approaches establishing an
isomorphism between the resulting Hilbert spaces.

language and using Yang-Baxterisation of the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan
algebra are able to construct Lax operators and associated $r$-matrices of
classical integrable models. Thus new as well as known lattice systems of
different classes are generated including new types of collective integrable
models and canonical models with nonstandard $r$ matrices.
