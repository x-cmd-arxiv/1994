lines characteristic of disk H II regions and, in large part, ordered rotation.
We discuss the following four possible explanations for the morphological and
spectroscopic peculiarities in the spiral: (1) a super--wind scenario,
supported by the high FIR luminosity of the spiral, and by emission line
activity similar to that observed in FIR strong galaxies; (2) motion of the
spiral through a hot, relatively dense intergalactic medium, possibly
associated with the elliptical, that could affect the star formation rate and
create a brightened disk rim; (3) a faint companion in direct collision with
the disk, at $\Delta v_r \sim 1000$ \kms, that would straightforwardly explain
the existence of the different redshift systems; (4) a pole on collision by the
elliptical, that could produce the disturbed morphology and other properties of
the spiral. The elliptical/spiral pole--on collision explains the high velocity
line emitting regions as tidally stripped gas, and accounts for the presence of
gas ionized by moterate velocity shocks. The morphology of Mrk 984 is
consistent

  Rev. Lett. 72, 772 (1994)",,"10.1016/0921-4526(94)90456-1",,"cond-mat",,"  The macroscopic quantum tunneling of a planar domain wall in a ferromagnetic
metal is studied by use of an instanton method. Based on the Hubbard model, the
effective action of the magnetization is derived within the assumption of slow
dependences on space and time. The resulting action is formally similar to that
of a ferromagnetic Heisenberg model but with a term non-local in time that
describes the dissipation due to the itinerant electron. The crucial difference
from the case of the insulator is the presence of the ohmic dissipation even at
zero temperature due to the gapless Stoner excitation. The reduction of the
tunneling rate due to the dissipation is calculated. The dissipative effect is
found to be very large for a thin domain wall with thickness of a few times the
lattice spacing, but is negligible for a thick domain wall. The results are
discussed in the light of recent experiments on ferromagnets with strong
anisotropy. (Submitted to J. Phys. Soc. Jpn)
