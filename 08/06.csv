beamed remnants of Quasi Stellar Objects. The hypothesis explains why BLLs do
not undergo the strong evolution seen in other active galactic nuclei since it
naturally predicts that the space density of BLLs should increase with cosmic
time, as shown by recent observations. Numerical models reproduce, with
reasonable parameters, the known redshift and magnitude counts of BL Lac
objects. It is assumed that radio-quiet as well as radio-loud quasars are
capable of generating jets but that jets are snuffed in young radio-quiet
objects and only emerge in aged ones. I argue that the observations allow this
assumption.

a line vortex in a type-II superconductor at $T=0$ is given. We first examine
the Berry phase induced in the true superconducting ground state by movement of
the vortex and show how this induces a Wess-Zumino term in the hydrodynamic
action $S_{hyd}$ of the superconducting condensate. Appropriate variation of
$S_{hyd}$ gives ${\bf F}_{nd}$ and variation of the Wess-Zumino term is seen to
contribute the Magnus (lift) force of classical hydrodynamics to ${\bf F}_
{nd}$. This first calculation confirms and strengthens earlier work by Ao and
Thouless which was based on an ansatz for the many-body ground state. We also
determine ${\bf F}_{nd}$ through a microscopic derivation of the continuity
equation for the condensate linear momentum. This equation yields the
acceleration equation for the superflow and shows that the vortex acts as a
sink for the condensate linear momentum. The rate at which momentum is lost to
the vortex determines ${\bf F}_{nd}$ and the result obtained agrees with the
Berry phase calculation. The Magnus force contribution to ${\bf F}_{nd}$ is
seen to be a consequence of the vortex topology. Preliminary remarks are made
regarding finite temperature extensions, with emphasis on its relevance to the
sign anomaly occurring in Hall effect experiments done in the flux flow regime.
