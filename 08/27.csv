profiles to non-parametrically determine the mass density profiles and
isotropic phase-space distribution functions $f(E)$ for the globular clusters
M15 (NGC7078), 47~Tuc (NGC104), NGC~362, and NGC~3201. Assuming isotropy and
using the velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles, the Jeans
equation uniquely determines the mass density profile. In the two
centrally-concentrated clusters, M15 and 47~Tuc, we find that the mass-to-light
ratios (M/L's) reach minima around 1\arcmin, and increase by more than a factor
of four towards the cluster centers. For the two less centrally concentrated
clusters, the M/L decreases monotonically all the way into the center. All four
clusters exhibit an increase in the M/L's in their outer parts. If the
variations in the M/L's are due to equipartition of energy between different
mass stars, then we attribute the central increases to massive remnants and the
outer increases to low-mass stars (m$<0.3$M$_\odot$). By applying the crude
approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derive the present-day
mass function for each cluster. In the central 2--3 parsecs, 0.7--1.5 M$_\odot$
objects provide the bulk of the cluster mass. The paper is in a uuencoded

associated with clusters of galaxies can magnify background sources, leading to
an enhancement of source number density around foreground clusters of galaxies.
We conduct a search for the associations of distant radio-bright quasars with
Abell clusters using the 1-Jy and 2-Jy all-sky catalogs. Statistics turns to be
very poor on the basis of the 1-Jy sample, which shows no correlations between
the distant radio quasars with the foreground Abell clusters above $1\sigma$
level. However, an apparent association ($>1\sigma$) of the 2-Jy radio sources
with the foreground Abell clusters has been detected on scale of $\sim20$
arcminutes. We point out that this enhancement is unlikely to be produced by
the statistical gravitational lensing hypothesis utilizing the matter
associated with a population of isolated clusters unless (1)their velocity
dispersion is a few times larger than the presently adopted value and/or (2)the
intrinsic counts of the radio-bright sources with flux have a steeper slope
than the presently observed ones. This indicates that (1)the observed
associations, if real, can be the integrated result of all the matter along the
line of sight to the distant quasars, namely, the weak lensing effect of
clusters of galaxies that trace large-scale structures of the universe, and/or
(2)the number counts of the radio-bright sources have been seriously
contaminated by lensing.

terms of gauge invariant field variables including an additional global (only

This additional variable reflects the symmetry group of topologically
nontrivial transformations remaining after the reduction. ( It gives also the
characteristic of the Gribov ambiguity from the point of view of the gauge
fixing method.) The perturbation theory in terms of quasiparticles with the new
