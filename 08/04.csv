accretion disk. It is assumed that: (1) the funnel walls emit black body
radiation with temperature decreasing outwards; (2) the magnetic and electric
fields are longitudinal in the funnel. Such a scenario is consistent with
models in which a large potential drop is induced by a rotating massive black
hole threaded by a magnetic field (Blandford & Znajek 1977, Macdonald & Thorne
1982). The interaction of relativistic protons with thermal photons from the
funnel results in direct production of pairs and/or pions. We discuss the
relative importance of these processes for different conditions in the funnel
(temperature and electric field profiles). Injected pairs interact with thermal
photons in the Thomson or Klein-Nishina regime. Under some conditions, a pair
avalanche results, which we assume saturates in the production of stable
bunches, containing almost equal numbers of electrons and positrons. As a
consequence, highly collimated gamma-ray photons are produced. We obtain
gamma-ray spectra from our model in order to test its applicability to the
gamma-ray emitting AGNs recently reported by EGRET.

case is an impurity free to move between only two sites, which interacts
locally with s-wave electrons. For Z greater or equal to 2 the hopping of the

localization. In this paper it is shown that other processes, in particular
joint hopping of the impurity and one or more electrons between the sites, play
an important role and have not been treated properly in the literature. Being
relevant in a renormalization group sense, even when Z greater or equal to 2,
these terms lead to delocalization of the impurity. Using bosonization, it is
shown how these processes are generated from marginal operators that are

relating both our field-theoretic approach to a direct mode elimination and our
anisotropic scaling to the general problem of incorporating curvature of the

how they follow from renormalization group equations for finite-size scaling,
where the size may be set by the temperature or by the frequency of interest.

composite operators, including in some cases dangerous ``irrelevant''

requirement and in its positive role providing Ward identities constraining the

assumptions: the Lagrangian is that of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model with arbitrary soft-breaking terms, and all couplings remain perturbative
up to scales of order 10^16 GeV; there are no assumptions about the soft SUSY
breaking parameters, proton decay, cosmology, etc. In particular, if the LEP

little deviation from the SM is predicted within ""super-unified"" SUSY. Finally,
it appears to be extremely difficult to find any unified MSSM model, regardless

piecewise deterministic process is given that can be used for a computer
simulation of real time series of experiments on single quantum objects. As an
example a generalized cloud chamber is described, including multiparticle case.
Relation to the GRW spontaneous localization model is discussed. The second
revised version of the paper contains references to papers by other authors
that are are aiming in the same direction: to enhance quantum theory in such a
way that it will provide stochastic description of events triggered by
individual quantum systems.

particle in a scalar $N$-prong potential. Such a study is of special interest
since these situations are intermediate between one and two dimensions. The
energy levels for the special case of $N$ identical prongs exhibit an
alternating pattern of non-degeneracy and $(N-1)$ fold degeneracy. It is shown
that the techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be used to generate
new solutions. Solutions for prongs of arbitrary lengths are developed.
Discussions of tunneling in $N$-well potentials and of scattering for piecewise
constant potentials are given. Since our treatment is for general values of
$N$, the results can be studied in the large $N$ limit. A somewhat surprising
result is that a free particle incident on an $N$-prong vertex undergoes
continuously increased backscattering as the number of prongs is increased.

cosmology. The simplest one is inflation without self-reproduction of the
universe. In this scenario the universe is not stationary. The second regime,
which exists in a broad class of inflationary models, is eternal inflation with
the self-reproduction of inflationary domains. In this regime local properties
of domains with a given density and given values of fields do not depend on the
time when these domains were produced. The probability distribution to find a
domain with given properties in a self-reproducing universe may or may not be
stationary, depending on the choice of an inflationary model. We give examples
of models where each of these possibilities can be realized, and discuss some
implications of our results for quantum cosmology. In particular, we propose a
new mechanism which may help solving the cosmological constant problem.

fields of half-integer conformal weights. This yields representations of
fermionic 2-point functions in terms of correlators of primary fields with a
factorized transformation behavior under the Lorentz group. I employ this
observation to determine the general structure of the corresponding Lorentz
covariant correlators by methods similar to the methods employed in conformal
field theory to determine 2- and 3-point functions of primary fields. In
particular, the chiral symmetry breaking terms resemble fermionic 2-point
functions of 2D CFT up to a function of the product of momenta. The
construction also permits for the formulation of covariant meromorphy
constraints on spinors in 3+1 dimensions.
