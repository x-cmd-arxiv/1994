stellar nucleosynthesis processes and, in addition, O abundances are an
important input for stellar age determinations. Understanding the nature of the
observed distribution of these elements is key to constraining protogalactic
star formation history. Patterns deduced from low-resolution spectroscopy of
the CN, CH, NH, and CO molecules for low-mass stars in their core-hydrogen or
first shell-hydrogen burning phases in the oldest ensembles known, the Galactic
globular star clusters, are reviewed. New results for faint stars in NGC 104
(47 Tuc, C0021-723) reveal that the bimodal, anticorrelated pattern of CN and
CH strengths found among luminous evolved stars is also present in stars
nearing the end of their main-sequence lifetimes. In the absence of known
mechanisms to mix newly synthesized elements from the interior to the
observable surface layers of such unevolved stars, those particular
inhomogeneities imply that the original material from which the stars formed
some 15 billion years ago was chemically inhomogeneous in the C and N elements.
However, in other clusters, observations of abundance ratios and C isotope
ratios suggest that alterations to surface chemical compositions are produced
as stars evolve from the main sequence through the red giant branch. Thus, the
current observed distributions of C, N, and O among the brightest stars (those
also observed most often) may not reflect the true distribution from which the
protocluster cloud formed. The picture which is emerging of the C, N and O
abundance patterns within globular clusters may be one which

relative to bright ones has been interpreted as support for cosmological
distances: faint bursts have their durations redshifted relative to bright
ones. It was pointed out, however, that the relative time stretching can also
be produced by an intrinsic correlation between duration and luminosity of
gamma-ray bursts in a nearby, bounded distribution. While both models can
explain the average amount of time stretching, we find a difference between
them in the way the duration distribution of faint bursts deviates from that of
bright ones, assuming the luminosity function of gamma-ray bursts is
independent of distance. This allows us to distinguish between these two broad
classes of model on the basis of the duration distributions of gamma-ray
bursts, leading perhaps to an unambiguous determination of the distance scale
of gamma-ray bursts. We apply our proposed test to the second BATSE catalog and
conclude, with some caution, that the data favor a cosmological interpretation
of the time dilation.

  Journal, July 20, 1994",,"10.1086/175173",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the width of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) luminosity function through
the distribution of GRB peak count rates, C$_{\rm{peak}}$, as detected by BATSE
(\cite{batse:93}). In the context of galactic corona spatial distribution
models, we attempt to place constraints on the characteristic width of the
luminosity function by comparing the observed intensity distribution with those
produced by a range of density and luminosity functions. We find that the
intrinsic width of the luminosity function cannot be very well restricted.
However, the distribution of intrinsic luminosities of {\it detected bursts}
can be limited: we find that most observed bursts have luminosities that are in
a range of one to two decades, but a significant population of undetected less
luminous bursts cannot be excluded. These findings demonstrate that the
assumption that GRB are standard candles is sufficient but not necessary to
explain the observed intensity distribution. We show that the main reason for
the relatively poor constraints is the fact that the bright-end part of the GRB
flux distribution is not yet sampled by BATSE, and better sampling in the
future may lead to significantly stronger constraints on the width of the
luminosity function.

analysis for constraining the intrinsic shapes of clusters of galaxies

We restrict analysis to aggregate cluster shapes on scales of $r\sim 1-2$ Mpc
to reduce our sensitivity to core subclustering. For low redshifts $(z\lesssim
0.25)$ the X-ray method accurately measures the true ellipticity of the
three-dimensional cluster dark matter; assuming the gas is isothermal adds only
small errors. At higher redshifts the X-ray method yields unreliable results
since the gas does not trace the cluster gravitational potential. We proffer
necessary conditions for the reliability of X-ray methods characterized by the
amount of substructure in the X-ray surface brightness images and the isophotal
shapes. We conclude that measurements of aggregate cluster shapes on scales
$r\sim 1-2$ Mpc are insensitive to core substructure on scales of a few hundred
kpc. Therefore our results suggest that the X-ray measurements of aggregate
cluster shapes by Fabricant, Rybicki, & Gorenstein and Buote & Canizares are
valid provided that they do not suffer from serious projection effects. A
substantial number of Abell clusters observed with the ROSAT PSPC will be
amenable to X-ray shape analysis.

in terms of Georgi's vector limit. We discuss three cases as possible support
for this scenario: Quark-number susceptibility, cool kaons in heavy-ion process
and an instanton-molecule picture for chiral restoration. Both the notion of
``mended symmetry"" and the Georgi vector limit are suggested to be relevant in
nuclear physics of dense matter.

terms in supersymmetric theories lead to powerful results. They are the
underlying conceptual reason for the important non-renormalization theorems.
They also enable us to study the exact non-perturbative dynamics of these
theories. We find explicit realizations of known phenomena as well as new ones
in four dimensional strongly coupled field theories. These shed new light on
confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. This note is based on a talk
delivered at the PASCOS (94) meeting at Syracuse University.

contributions arising from supersymmetric multiplets greatly simplifies these
calculations. We also discuss how unitarity may be used to constrain the

photons due to modifications of the vacuum, finding that it is given by a
universal constant times the quotient of the difference of energy densities
between the usual and modified vacua over the mass of the electron to the
fourth power. Whether photons move faster or slower than $c$ depends only on
the lower or higher energy density of the modified vacuum, respectively.
Physically, a higher energy density is characterized by the presence of
additional particles (real or virtual) in the vacuum whereas a lower one stems
from the absence of some virtual modes. We then carry out a systematic study of
the speed of propagation of massless particles for several field theories up to
two loops on a thermal vacuum. Only low--energy massless particles
corresponding to a massive theory show genuine modifications of their speed
while remaining massless. All other modifications are mass-related, or running
mass-related. We also develop a formalism for the Casimir vacuum which
parallels the thermal one and check that photons travel faster than $c$ between
plates.
