Kalb-Ramond action with an analogous derivation to that for the point electron
in classical electrodynamics. We show how local corrections to the equations of
motion allow one to separate the self-field of the string from that of the
radiation-field. Modifications to this 'local backreaction approximation'
circumvent the runaway solutions familiar from electrodynamics, allowing these
corrections to be used to evolve string trajectories numerically. Comparisons
are made with analytic and numerical radiation calculations from previous work
and the merits and limitations of this approach are discussed. Finally, we
comment on the relevance of this work to simulations of a cosmological network
of global or axion strings. These methods can also be applied to describe
graviational, electromagnetic and other forms of string radiative backreaction.

Our damped dynamics has efficiency comparable to that of conjugate gradient

plane-wave expansions. The maximum allowed time step is dictated by the highest
frequency components of the fictitious electronic dynamics. These can result
either from the large wavevector components of the kinetic energy or from the

the actual measurement of the $B(b\to s\gamma)$ branching ratio from CLEO. In
particular, the sign of the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$ is fixed. A more
precise measurement of the top-quark mass above (below) $\approx160\GeV$ would
disfavor the dilaton (moduli) scenario. Similarly a measurement of the lightest
Higgs-boson mass above 90 GeV (below 100 GeV) would disfavor the dilaton
(moduli) scenario. At the Tevatron with $100\ipb$, the reach into parameter
space is significant only in the dilaton scenario ($m_{\chi^\pm_1}\lsim80\GeV$)

be probed up the kinematical limit via chargino and top-squark pair production,

of a high-dimensional object (p-brane). The interaction is found to be mediated
by a gauge boson of a completely antisymmetric tensor of rank $p+1$.

random surfaces coupled to matter fields with $c=1$. Using baby universe
surgery it was possible to simulate randomly triangulated surfaces made of
260.000 triangles. Our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction
$d_H = 2+\sqrt{2}$ for the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension.

critical coupling $\alpha_s^c$ the light quark vacuum undergoes a series of
phase transitions which should be taken into account in the application of
chiral perturbation theory. The Gribov theory offers a simple explanation of
the value of the pion nucleon sigma term without need to invoke a large strange
quark component in the nucleon.
