discussed. It is shown that if the concentration of H$_{2}$formation sites is
low and resurfacing is active, fractal structure of grains enhances their
alignment. Studying the influence of grain surface physics and chemistry on the
alignment we found that there exist two critical values of grain sizes, and the
alignment of smaller grains is expected to decrease as compared to the
predictions of the Purcell's theory (1979). One of the critical sizes is due to
intensified poisoning of active sites, while the other is a result of a finite
value of the imaginary part of magnetic susceptibility in the limit of high
angular velocities. On the contrary, if active sites completely cover grain
surface, suprathermal rotation, and therefore efficient alignment, is possible
only for a limited range of grain sizes.

gauge theories and quantum gravity, when formulated in a covariant way, should
be related to background fields with covariantly constant curvature, gauge
field strength and potential term. It is shown that the condition of the
covariant constancy of the background curvatures brings into existence some Lie
algebra. The heat kernel operator for the Laplace operator is presented then as
an average over the corresponding Lie group with some nontrivial Gaussian
measure. Using this representation the heat kernel diagonal is obtained. The
result is expressed purely in terms of curvature invariants and is explicitly
covariant. Related topics concerning the structure of symmetric spaces and the
calculation of the effective action are discussed.

find relations between the three four-fermion couplings $g_t, g_b,$ and
$g_{tb}$ and show the new result that they may all be finite, with $g\Lambda

There is a new symmetry of ${\cal L}_{\rm int}$, corresponding to a flat
direction in the space of composite states. Breaking this symmetry by turning
on one small eigenvalue of the coupling matrix turns on the quark masses and
introduces the massive Higgs state, so that $m_b,m_t,m_H\ll \Lambda$ is

Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert gravity formulated in space-time dimensions $D >2$.

superdifferential operators with matrix-valued coefficients. The associated
Miura transformation is derived. Using this bracket we work out a nonlocal and
nonlinear N=2 superalgebra which contains the N=2 super Virasoro algebra as a
subalgebra. The bosonic limit of this algebra is considered. We show that when
the spin-1 fields in this bosonic algebra are set to zero the resulting Dirac
bracket gives precisely the recently derived $V_{2,2}$ algebra.

  and Disordered Phases","16 pages, a new section inserted instead of Eq. (4.15)",,,,"hep-th",,"  The Kyoto group (Jimbo, Miwa, Nakayashikiet al.) showed that the partition
function and correlation funtions of the eight-vertex model in
antiferromagnetic phases can be calculated using simple analytical properties
of the $R$-matrix. We extend these methods to ferromagnetic and disordered
phases. We use Baxter's symmetries to obtain appropriate parametrizations of
the $R$-matrix and to substantiate the validity of the analytical approach for
these phases. These symmetries allow one to relate correlation functions in
different phases.

validity of perturbation theory. For this purpose we study a Euclidean field
theory with two scalars and discrete symmetry in four dimensions. The phase
diagram is established by a numerical solution of a suitable truncation of
exact non-perturbative flow equations. We find regions in parameter space where
the phase transition (in dependence on the mass term) is of the second or the
first order, separated by a triple point. Our quantitative results for the
first order phase transition compare well to the standard perturbative
Coleman-Weinberg calculation of the effective potential.

the $g$-factors of the Os-Pt isotopes are resolved by a proper inclusion of
F-spin breaking.
