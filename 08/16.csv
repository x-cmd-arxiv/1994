excitement, and have been interpreted as due to `dark objects' (MACHOs) in the
halo of our Galaxy. It is shown here that the stars within the LMC play a
dominant role as gravitational lenses and can indeed account for the observed
events. The MACHO event and one of the EROS events lie within the bar for which
the probability of microlensing is consistent with being caused by an object
within the LMC. If the stars within the LMC play a dominant role as lenses, the
events should be concentrated towards the center of the LMC. If MACHOs play a
dominant role as lenses then, for a given number of monitored stars, the events
should be uniformly distributed over the whole of the LMC. Thus the galactic
and the LMC lenses can be statistically distinguished in most cases. It is
further shown that, under certain conditions, the light curve of an event
caused by a star within the LMC would be different from the one caused by a
MACHO. This can also be a distinguishing signature, and seems to have been
observed in case of the MACHO event. The fit discrepancy near the peak which
the authors say ``is not yet understood"" would be a natural consequence if the
event is caused by an object within the LMC, which further indicates that the
lensing is due to a low mass star within the LMC itself.

  Distortions. II. Generalization of the Kaiser & Squires Method","23 pages",,,"MPA report 823","astro-ph",,"  The weak distortions of high-redshift galaxies caused by gravitational light
deflection near clusters of galaxies can be used to reconstruct the projected
(two-dimensional) surface mass density of intermediate redshift clusters. This
technique, pioneered by Tyson, Valdes & Wenk, and Kaiser & Squires, is
reconsidered in the present paper, where we generalize the inversion equation
found by Kaiser & Squires (KS) in several respect. Adopting a different
smoothing procedure for the discreetly sampled data (individual galaxy images),
we effectively reduce the shot noise in the KS procedure. In particular we show
that the best density reconstructions are obtained if the smoothing scale is
adopted to the `strength of the signal', which yields a better resolution near
the center of the cluster where the distortions are strongest. Furthermore, we
point out the importance of boundary effects and demonstrate their disastrous
impact on rectangular data fields (CCDs) with large side ratio. Most important,
however, is the generalization of the KS method to critical clusters, i.e., to
such clusters which are capable of producing multiple images and giant luminous
arcs. The corresponding modifications of the inversion procedure are severe; in
particular, the resulting inversion equation is much more difficult to solve.
As we pointed out in a previous paper (Schneider & Seitz), there exists a local
degeneracy if the cluster is critical. We have developed an iteration procedure
to solve the inversion equation, which we demonstrate to yield a very accurate

factor of 1000 and have been persuasively associated with compact objects.
Here, a model of super-Eddington radiation transfer on the surface of a
strongly magnetic ($\geq 10^{13}$ gauss) neutron star is studied and related to
the observational constraints on soft gamma repeaters. In strong magnetic
fields, the cross-section to electron scattering is strongly suppressed in one
polarization state, so super-Eddington fluxes can be radiated while the plasma
remains in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model offers a somewhat natural
explanation for the observation of similarity between spectra from bursts of
varying intensity. The radiation produced in the model is found to be linearly
polarized to about 1 part in 1000 in a direction determined by the local
magnetic field, and the large intensity variations between bursts are
understood as a change in the radiating area on the source. Therefore, the
polarization may vary as a function of burst intensity, since the complex
structure of the magnetic field may be more apparent for larger radiating
areas. It is shown that for radiation transfer calculations in this limit of
super-strong magnetic fields it is sufficient to solve the radiation transfer
equations for the low opacity state rather than the coupled equations for both.
With this approximation, standard stellar atmosphere techniques are utilized to
calculate the model energy spectrum.

interaction, which produces a double cascade, one at either end of a lightly

emphasizing the sensitivity to quark intrinsic transverse momentum. We show how
to derive the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule in this approach and derive a
similar sum rule for the chiral-odd distribution $h_2$. The effect of intrinsic
transverse momentum in experimental observables is illustrated in the
calculation of the ${\cal O}(1/Q)$ double-spin asymmetry $A_{LT}$ in Drell-Yan
scattering.

building on a recently proposed gauge theory of the string geodesic field. We
show that this stochastic approach is equivalent to the Carath\'eodory
formulation of the Nambu-Goto action, supplemented by an averaging procedure
over the family of classical string world-sheets which are solutions of the
equation of motion. In this new framework, the string geodesic field is
reinterpreted as the Gibbs current density associated with the string
statistical ensemble. Next, we show that the classical field equations derived
from the string gauge action, can be obtained as the semi-classical limit of
the string functional wave equation. For closed strings, the wave equation
itself is completely analogous to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation used in quantum
cosmology. Thus, in the string case, the wave function has support on the space
of all possible spatial loop configurations. Finally, we show that the string
distribution induces a multi-phase, or {\it cellular} structure on the
spacetime manifold characterized by domains with a purely Riemannian geometry
separated by domain walls over which there exists a predominantly Weyl
geometry.

the topological mass (more precisely, to the parity-odd part of the vacuum
polarization tensor at zero momentum) in a wide class of abelian gauge theories

rather than in terms of the vacuum polarization tensor. The theorem so restated
becomes somewhat stronger: a known exception to the theorem, spontaneously
broken scalar Chern-Simons electrodynamics, obeys the new non-renormalization
theorem. Whereas the vacuum polarization {\sl does} receive a one-loop,
parity-odd correction, this does not translate to a radiative contribution to
the Chern-Simons term in the effective action. We also point out a new
situation, involving scalar fields and parity-odd couplings, which was
overlooked in the original analysis, where the conditions of the theorem are
satisfied and where the topological mass does, in fact, get a radiative
correction.
