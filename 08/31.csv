  number 828",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In a recent paper by Rodrigues-Williams \& Hogan (RH94), a correlation
between high-redshift, optically-selected QSOs and Zwicky clusters was reported
at a very high significance level. Due to the fairly bright flux threshold of
the cluster sample, these correlations cannot be interpreted as being due to an
environmental effect of the clusters on the quasar activity. The most likely
interpretation employed in RH94 was the effect of gravitational lensing by the
foreground clusters, though the required magnification to explain the observed
correlations has to be considerably higher than obtained from simple mass
models for the clusters. We have repeated the analysis of RH94 using a
different QSO sample, namely radio quasars and radio galaxies from the 1-Jy
sample. In accordance with RH, we detect a statistically significant
correlation between Zwicky clusters and 1-Jy sources with intermediate redshift
($z\approx 1$), but fail to detect significant effects for higher-redshift
sources. In addition, we detect a highly significant underdensity of
low-redshift radio sources around Zwicky clusters, for which an environmental
interpretation seems to be most reasonable. Our result for the overdensity of
$z\sim 1$ sources is in good agreement with previous results and can possibly
be interpreted as a lensing effect, though we have not tried to quantitatively
investigate a lensing model. Other interpretations, such as patchy dust
obscuration, can not explain the observed effect and its tendency with
redshift.

COBE-DMR two year sky maps are used to infer the parameter Q_{rms-PS}, which
characterizes the normalization of power law models of primordial cosmological
temperature anisotropy. In particular, a 'cross'-RMS statistic is used to
determine Q_{rms-PS} for a forced fit to a scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich
(n = 1) spectral model. Using a joint analysis of the 7 degree and 10 degree
RMS temperature derived from both the 53 and 90 GHz sky maps, we find
Q_{rms-PS} = 17.0^{+2.5}_{-2.1} uK when the low quadrupole is included, and
Q_{rms-PS} = 19.4^{+2.3}_{-2.1} uK excluding the quadrupole. These results are
consistent with the n = 1 fits from more sensitive methods (e.g. power
spectrum, correlation function). The effect of the low quadrupole derived from
the COBE-DMR data on the inferred Q_{rms-PS} normalization is investigated. A
bias to lower Q_{rms-PS} is found when the quadrupole is included. The higher
normalization for a forced n = 1 fit is then favored by the cross-RMS
technique. As initially pointed out in Wright et al. (1994a) and further
discussed here, analytic formulae for the RMS sky temperature fluctuations will
NOT provide the correct normalization amplitude.

x-ray sources has been often suggested to resolve some pecularities in the
properties of the x-ray background (XRB), and has recently been indicated by an
analysis of resolved sources in deep ROSAT observations (Hasinger \etal 1993).
  We investigate the possibility that the indicated new population of x-ray
sources is Galactic in origin, and derive its properties which would resolve
the discrepancy found in the number counts of faint sources, and be consistent
with observational constraints on the total background intensity, the XRB
anisotropy, the number of unidentified bright sources, the Galaxy's total x-ray
luminosity, and with the results of fluctuation analyses of the unresolved XRB.
  We find that a flattened Galactic halo (or a thick disk) distribution with a
scale height of a few Kpc satisfies all the above requirements. The typical
x-ray luminosity of the sources is $\approx 10^{30-31}$ erg/s in the 0.5-2 KeV
band, the number density of sources in the Solar vicinity is $\sim 10^{-4.5}
pc^{-3}$, their total number in the Galaxy is $\sim 10^{8.5}$, and they
contribute $\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s to the Galaxy's total x-ray luminosity.
  We discuss the possible nature of these sources (subdwarfs, LMXBs, old
neutron stars), and argue that the inferred x-ray and optical luminosities of
the sources, their $\sim 2-4$ KeV spectrum, and the derived local number
density and spatial distribution are all consistent with them being intrinsicly
faint cataclysmic variables with low accretion rates. We discuss the possible
origin of such population, including an origin from disrupted globular clusters
or dark clusters, make predictions, and suggest observational tests.

spectral temperature diagnostics is established by analyzing synthetic ASCA
Solid-state Imaging Spectrometer (SIS) CCD spectra. The diagnostics considered
are the ratio of hydrogen-like to helium-like line complexes of $Z\ge14$
elements, line-free portions of the continuum, and the entire spectrum. While
fits to the entire spectrum yield the highest statistical precision, it is
argued that fits to the line-free continuum are less susceptible to atomic data
uncertainties but lead to a modest increase in statistical uncertainty over
full spectral fits. Temperatures deduced from line ratios can have similar
accuracy but only over a narrow range of temperatures. Convenient estimates of
statistical accuracies for the various temperature diagnostics are provided
which may be used in planning ASCA SIS observations.

correlator receives essential contributions from direct ({\it i.e.}
small-scale) instantons, which we evaluate under the assumption of an instanton
size distribution consistent with instanton liquid and lattice simulations. The
resulting form factor is in good agreement both with the sum rule based on the
axial-current correlator and with experiment.

for the exterior derivative and might hence also be of interest in the recent
work on its deformations. The Cartan identity for the Lie derivatives is

quantized electromagnetic field. The amplitudes of the interference maxima are
changed by a factor which depends upon a double line integral of the photon
two-point function around the closed path of the electrons. The interference
pattern is sensitive to shifts in the vacuum fluctuations in regions from which
the electrons are excluded. Thus this effect combines aspects of both the
Casimir and the Aharonov-Bohm effects. The coupling to the quantized
electromagnetic field tends to decrease the amplitude of the interference
oscillations, and hence is a form of decoherence. The contributions due to
photon emission and to vacuum fluctuations may be separately identified. It is
to be expected that photon emission leads to decoherence, as it can reveal
which path an electron takes. It is less obvious that vacuum fluctuations also
can cause decoherence. What is directly observable is a shift in the
fluctuations due, for example, to the presence of a conducting plate. In the
case of electrons moving parallel to conducting boundaries, the dominant
decohering influence is that of the vacuum fluctuations. The shift in the
interference amplitudes can be of the order of a few percent, so experimental
verification of this effect may be possible. The possibility of using this
effect to probe the interior of matter, e.g., to determine the electrical
conductivity of a rod by means of electrons encircling it is discussed.

BBGKY density matrix hierarchy on the two-body level leads to a coupled set of
nonlinear equations of motion for the one-body density matrix and the two-body
correlation function. These equations provide a nonperturbative description of
the nonequilibrium time evolution of particle number conserving bosonic
many-body systems including the dynamical resummation of parquet-like diagrams.
Within this framework we study the properties of a pionic system as a function
of temperature and density with focus on two-body quantities. For each
temperature we find a related pion density for which the relative strength of
the two-body correlation function assumes a maximum and the pionic system is
far from the mean-field limit. Since these correlated phases up to $T$=200 MeV
only appear at rather low pion density, the hot and dense pion gas as generated
in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions should be well described within
mean-field theory; i.e. the HBT analysis of pion sources from $\pi-\pi$
correlations should remain valid even in the case of strongly interacting
pions.
