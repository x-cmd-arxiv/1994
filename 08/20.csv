computed from a new survey of faint galaxies covering a 2 deg$^2$ area near the
North Galactic Pole. This survey, which is complete to limiting magnitudes
\jmag=24 and \fmag=23, samples angular scales as large as $1\degpoint5$. Faint
galaxies are found to be more weakly clustered (by a factor of at least two)
compared to galaxies observed locally. Clustering amplitudes are closer to
model predictions in the red than in the blue. The weak clustering of faint
galaxies cannot be explained by any plausible model of clustering evolution
with redshift. However, one possible explanation of the clustering properties
of intermediate redshift galaxies is that they resemble those of starburst
galaxies and H II region galaxies, which are observed locally to possess weak
clustering amplitudes. Our clustering amplitudes are also similar to those of
nearby late-type galaxies, which are observed to be more weakly clustered than
early-type galaxies A simple, self-consistent model is presented that predicts
the fraction of galaxies in the ``excess'' population at intermediate
redshifts, and correctly matches observed color distributions. The available
data on the clustering properties of faint galaxies are consistent with this
model if the ``excess'' population of faint blue galaxies is also the weakly
clustered population. Evidence is presented that the power-law slope of the
angular correlation function becomes shallower at fainter magnitudes. A similar
effect is seen locally both for dwarf galaxies and for galaxies with late
morphological type;

its double nature. Our group algorithm clearly detects two subconcentrations

than the age of the Universe, they appear bound and virialized. It is
surprising that although $M/L$ is small in these clusters, giant arcs have been
detected in both.

Pole. Due to the excellent star/galaxy discrimination we count stars as faint
as \jmag = 23. We compare the number counts and colour distributions in 5
adjacent fields near SA57. The number counts and colour distributions are in
very good agreement with previous data. However, we find that the large
field-to-field scatter in the colour distributions, which we argue is real,
might prevent us setting strong limits on Galactic structure. A simple two
component standard model, Bahcall and Soneira (1984), fits the number counts
reasonably well at the bright \jmag $< 21$, but fails notably at the faint end,
even if a third component is added, as in Reid and Majewski (1993). The
standard models are in good agreement with both the number counts and colour
distribution at $20 < $\vmag$< 21$. Although the standard models bimodal shape
of the colour distribution compares well with the data at $21 < $\vmag$< 21.5$,
the number counts of stars are underestimated.

the quotient of a real analytic manifold of dimension $3k-6$ by a finite group

isotropy subgroup of the surface in the group of Euclidean motions. It is of
interest to note that the dimension of $\Mk$ is independent of the topology of
the underlying punctured Riemann surface to which $\Sig$ is conformally
equivalent. These results also apply to hypersurfaces of $\HH^{n+1}$ with

as the causes of the incompatibility between the two different ways of

scientific ones. The conflict between quantum mechanics and (general)
relativity is shown to be a consequence of retaining the Newtonian conception
of time in the context of quantum mechanics. As a remedy for this conflict, an
alternative definition of time -- earlier presented in Kitada 1994a and 1994b
-- is reviewed with less mathematics and more emphasis on its philosophical
aspects. Based on this revised understanding of time it is shown that quantum
mechanics and general relativity are reconciled while preserving the current
