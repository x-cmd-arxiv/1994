has indicated that there are two physically distinct classes of these objects -
radio-loud and radio-quiet. The primary observational distinctions between the
two types are: (1) The radio-loud objects produce large scale radio jets and
lobes, with the kinetic power of the jets being a significant fraction of the
total bolometric luminosity. On the other hand, the weak radio ejecta of the
radio-quiet objects are energetically insignificant. (2) The radio-loud objects
are associated with elliptical galaxies which have undergone recent mergers,
while the radio-quiets prefer spiral hosts. (3) The space density of the
radio-louds at a given optical luminosity is $\approx$ 10 times lower than that
of the radio-quiets. Despite these differences, the (probably) thermal
emissions from the AGN (continua and lines from X-ray to infrared wavelengths)
are quite similar in the two classes of object. We argue that this last result
suggests that the black hole masses and mass accretion rates in the two classes
are not greatly different, and that the difference between the classes is
associated with the spin of the black hole.
  We assume that the normal process of accretion through a disk does not lead
to rapidly spinning holes, and propose instead that galaxies (e.g. spirals)
which have not suffered a recent major merger event contain non-rotating or
only slowly rotating black holes. When two such galaxies merge, the two black
holes are known to form a binary and we assume that they eventually coalesce.
In the small fraction of mergers in which the two ``parent'' galaxies contain
very massive holes of roughly equal mass, a rapidly spinning, very massive hole
results. It is proposed that such mergers are the progenitors of powerful radio

different parity violating properties would be characterized by diffusion
layers, analogous to those in the p-n junction. This remark is amplified by a
fuller investigation of two related parity violating effective Lagrangians,
which possess a kind of duality. It is shown that gauge invariance and energy
conservation are sufficient to determine the behaviour at the interface. This
leads to modifications of normal parity-violating electrodynamics. The coupling
of an interface to an external system is a natural solution to the deficiencies
of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. A heuristic model of a transistor-like device
is discussed which relates to recent experiments in device technology.
Radiative corrections to Chern-Simons theory induce a local magnetic moment
interaction whose lagrangian is everywhere gauge invariant. The effects of this
interaction are compared to Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The dispersion of
classical waves for these models is computed and the laws of reflection and
refraction are found to hold despite the lack of $P$ and $T$ invariance. The
magnetic moment dispersion is gapless in contrast to the Chern-Simons
dispersion except in the case of a scalar field which is covariantly constant.
Both models exhibit optical activity (Faraday effect).

Hajicek energy is conserved and has the behaviour appropriate to energy in the
Newtonian and special-relativistic limits. In the small-sphere limit, the
leading term in E is the product of volume and the energy density of the
matter. In vacuo, E reduces to the Schwarzschild energy. At null and spatial
infinity, E reduces to the Bondi-Sachs and Arnowitt-Deser-Misner energies
respectively. The conserved Kodama current has charge E. A sphere is trapped if
E>r/2, marginal if E=r/2 and untrapped if E<r/2, where r is the areal radius. A
central singularity is spatial and trapped if E>0, and temporal and untrapped

in the observable matter direction in generic superstring models. This happens
only when the fields whose VEVs give masses to hidden matter do not decouple at
the condensation scale. We find how the parameters of the string model and the
vacuum determine whether supersymmetry is broken mainly by hidden matter or
gaugino condensates and in the matter or moduli directions.

that is dissipation via particle production is studied in scalar field theories
in the unbroken and in the broken symmetry phase. We begin with a perturbative
study to one loop and show explicitly that the mechanism of dissipation via
particle production cannot be explained with a simple derivative term in the
equation of motion. The dissipative contribution is non-local and there does
not exist a local (Markovian) limit at zero temperature. Furthermore, we show
that both an amplitude as well as a one-loop calculation present instabilities,
requiring a non-perturbative resummation. Within the same approximations, we
study an O(2) linear sigma model that allows to study dissipation by Goldstone
bosons.
  We find infrared divergences that require non-perturbative resummation in
order to understand the long-time dynamics. We obtain a perturbative
  Langevin equation that exhibits a generalized fluctuation-dissipation
relation, with non-Markovian kernels and colored noise. We then study a
  Hartree approximation and clearly exhibit dissipative effects related to the
thresholds to particle production. The asymptotic dynamics depends on the
coupling and initial conditions but does not seem to lead to exponential
relaxation. The effect of dissipation by Goldstone bosons is studied
non-perturbatively in the large N limit in an O(N) theory. Dissipation produced
by Goldstone bosons dramatically changes the picture of the phase transition.
We find the remarkable result that for ``slow-roll'' initial conditions (with
the expectation value of the field initially near the origin) the final value
of the expectation value of the scalar field is very close to its initial
value. We find that the minima of the effective action depend on the initial
conditions. We provide extensive numerical analysis of the dynamics.

additional spectral-like parameters, providing generalizations of the
