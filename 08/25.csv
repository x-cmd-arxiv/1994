these to investigate their capability of imaging background sources into long
arcs. Emphasis is laid on the statistics of these arcs. We study cross sections
for arc length and length-to-width ratio and optical depths for these arc
properties, we examine the distribution of arc widths and curvature radii among
long arcs, and we compare these results to predictions based on simplified
(radially symmetric) cluster models. We find that the capability of the
numerically modeled clusters to produce long arcs is larger by about two orders
of magnitude than that of spherically symmetric cluster models with the same
observable parameters (core radii and velocity dispersions), and that they are
similarly efficient as singular isothermal spheres with the same
velocity-dispersion distribution. The influence of source ellipticity is also
investigated; we find that the optical depth for arcs with a length-to-width
ratio $\ga10$ is significantly larger for elliptical than for circular sources.
Given these results, we conclude that spherically symmetric lens models for
galaxy clusters, adapted to the observable parameters of these clusters,
grossly underestimate the frequency of long arcs. We attribute this difference
between numerically constructed and simplified analytical lens models to the
abundance and the extent of intrinsic asymmetry and to substructure in galaxy
clusters.

system near the double quasar has recently been reported, which, if real, would
set strong constraints on determinations of the Hubble constant from the time
delay in the double quasar. We find that both the morphology and the colors of
the claimed arc systems suggest that they are chance alignments of three and
two different objects, and not gravitationally lensed arcs. Hence, the
constraints on $H_0$-determinations from the arcs are not valid. Also, a small
group of galaxies at $z=0.5$ near the line-of-sight which was required to have
a very large mass in the physically interesting arc models, is most likely
insignificant. From our deep images we are able to use weak lensing of faint
background galaxies in the field to map the gravitational potential in the main
cluster. This sets new constraints on determinations of $H_0$. We find that the
Hubble constant is constrained to be less than 70km/(s Mpc), if the time delay
between the two images of the QSO is equal to or larger than 1.1 years.

conductance. For the simplified case of a channel with two extended (current

based solely on variations of the electromagnetic potentials and the metric. In
spite of this, only slight differences appear between the resulting
Schr\""odinger part, and the conventional theory of the Schr\""odinger field.
Close examination of the differences reveals that most are general relativistic
effects which are unobservable in flat spacetime, and which are estimated to
interact significantly only via their gravitational fields, or on scales
comparable with neutrino interaction cross sections. The only remaining
difference is that the wavefunction obeying the conjugate wave equation is not
always restricted to be exactly the complex conjugate of the primary
wavefunction. Generalizations of the model lead naturally to spinlike
phenomena, a possible new mechanism for a theory of rest mass, and spinor
connections containing the form of an SU(2) potential.

since the Einstein equations are a set of highly nonlinear equations which may
exhibit dynamically very complicated solutions for the space-time metric.
However, in general relativity it is not easy to construct indicators of chaos
which are gauge-invariant. Therefore it is reasonable to start by investigating
- at first - the possibility of a gauge-invariant description of local
instability. In this paper we examine an approach which aims at describing the
dynamics in purely geometrical terms. The dynamics is formulated as a geodesic
flow through the Maupertuis principle and a criterion for local instability of
the trajectories may be set up in terms of curvature invariants (e.g. the Ricci
scalar) of the manifold on which geodesic flow is generated. We discuss the
relation of such a criterion for local instability (negativity of the Ricci
scalar) to a more standard criterion for local instability and we emphasize
that no inferences can be made about global chaotic behavior from such local
criteria.

$L^p$}\/ space $\wlp$ consists of all measurable functions $f$ such that
  \[ \|f\| = \sup_{t>0}t^{\frac{1}{p}}f^*(t) < \infty,\]
  where $f^*$ is the decreasing rearrangement of $|f|$. It is a Banach space
under a norm which is equivalent to the expression above. In this paper, we
pursue the problem of classifying weak $L^p$ spaces isomorphically when $\msp$
is purely atomic. It is also shown that if $\msp$ is a countably generated
$\sigma$-finite measure space, then $\wlp$ (if infinite dimensional) must be
isomorphic to either $\ell^\infty$ or $\seq$.
  The results of this article were presented at the conference in Columbia,
Missouri in May, 1994.

coupled channel model is proposed to predict the isoscalar S-wave phase shifts
and inelasticities for $\pi \pi$ scattering in the 1.0 to 2.0 GeV region. The
S-matrix is required to exhibit poles corresponding to the established
isoscalar J$^{\pi}$ = 0$^+$ resonances f$_0$(975), f$_0$(1400), and
f$_0$(1710). A dominant feature of the experimental $\pi \pi$ inelasticity is
the clear opening of the $\bar{K}K$ channel near 1 GeV, and the opening of
another channel in the 1.4 - 1.5 GeV region. The success of our model in
predicting this observed dramatic energy dependence indicates that the effect
of multi-pion channels is adequately described by the $\pi \pi$ coupling to the
$\bar{K}K$ channel, the $\rho \rho$(4$\pi$) and $\omega \omega$(6$\pi$)
channels.
