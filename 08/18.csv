from adiabatic focusing in the solar wind frame and from differential solar
wind convection. An explicit formula is given for the deceleration of
individual particles as a function of the pitch angle. Deceleration and other
first-order effects of the solar wind, including convection, are incorporated
into a numerical code for simulating the transport of energetic particles along
the interplanetary magnetic field. We use this code to model the transport of
solar flare protons. We find that including deceleration can increase the decay
rate of the near-Earth intensity by 75\% more than would be expected based on
advection from higher momenta, due to an interplay with diffusive processes.
Improved response functions are derived for the impulsive injection of
particles near the Sun, and it is found that neglecting deceleration leads to
incorrect estimates of the scattering mean free path based on the intensity
decay alone, especially for lower-energy particles.

protogalactic clouds collide. We describe the formation of those star clusters
with a simple schematic ansatz which takes into account the thermal and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. It is shown that this model is consistent with
many observational properties such as the age and metallicity distributions of
globular clusters, the overall number of globular clusters, and the near
constancy of the number of globular clusters in different size host galaxies.
Most of the features of this merger model are insensitive to choices of
parameters. However, the model does not exhibit two distinct populations of
globular clusters, i.e. halo clusters and disk clusters. Possible explanations
for this are presented.

procedure which incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter halos,
the shock heating and radiative cooling of gas, self-regulated star formation,
the merging of galaxies within dark matter halos, and the spectral evolution of
the stellar populations. We contrast the standard CDM cosmogony with variants
of the CDM model having either a low value of H_0, or a low value of Omega with
or without a cosmological constant. In addition, we compare galaxy formation in
these CDM universes with a CHDM model. We find that although the models have
some success in remedying the shortcomings of the standard CDM cosmogony, none
of these new models produce broad agreement with the whole range of
observations. Although the low-Omega and Omega+Lambda=1 CDM models reduce the
discrepancy between the predicted and observed Tully-Fisher relations (the main
weakness of galaxy formation in standard CDM), these models predict an inverted
colour-magnitude relation and do not produce an exponential cut-off at the
bright end of the galaxy luminosity function. All of our models predict recent
star formation and exhibit galaxy colours bluer than observed, but this problem
is far more severe in the CHDM model which produces colours about two
magnitudes too blue in B-K. Unlike in the variants of the CDM model in the CHDM
case this result is not dependent on our model of stellar feedback, but is
instead directly caused by the late epoch of structure formation in this model.

competing with the cubic-to-tetragonal martensitic transition typical of these

depends critically on the choice of the quantum state and has been considered
in this paper by restricting to the case of quantum wormholes. It is seen that
pure states represented by a wave functional are time symmetric. However, a
maximal analytic extension of the wormhole manifold is found that corresponds
to a mixed state describable by a nondegenerate density-matrix functional that
involves an extra quantum uncertainty for the three-metric, and is free from
the divergences encountered so far in statistical states formulated in quantum
gravity. It is then argued that, relative to one asymptotic region, the
statistical quantum state of single Euclidean wormholes in semiclassical
approximation is time-asymmetric and gives rise to a {\it topological} arrow of
time which will reflect in the set of all quantum fields at low energies of the

first complete derivation of the extra terms (beyond the usual jacobian term)
which arises in the action when a nonlinear transformation is made. We comment
on possible connections with the renormalization group, by showing that these
extra terms may emerge from a ``blocking"" procedure. Finally, by performing
field redefinitions before and after dimensional reduction of a two dimensional
field theory, we derive an explicit form fo an extra term appearing in a field
theory.

as a result of the RG contributions. The effective potential for the conformal

time as the interior evolves from a pure gluon field to a $\overline q \ q$

according to the Schwinger mechanism using the results of Brink and Pavel. The
motion of the quarks toward the tube endcaps is calculated by a Boltzmann
equation including collisions. The tube undergoes damped radial oscillations
until the electric field settles down to zero. The electric field stabilizes
the tube against pinch instabilities; when the field vanishes, the tube
disintegrates into mesons. There is only one free parameter in the problem,
namely the initial flux tube radius, to which the results are very sensitive.
Among various quantities calculated is the mean energy of the emitted pions.
