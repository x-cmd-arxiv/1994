segregation of mass and light in a galaxy cluster. The relation between the
projected mass profile and the light profile, normalized by the virial $M/L$,
is presented as a function of $b_v\equiv\sigma_\ell/\sigma_\rho$, the ratio of
the RMS velocity dispersions of the galaxies and the underlying dark matter.
The light distribution does not trace the mass at any radius within the
cluster. At the apparent harmonic radius the gravitational mass can exceed the
virial mass calculated from the light by about a factor of 2 (or more). The
data for the MS1224+20 cluster, covering nearly a decade in radius, are well
described by a velocity bias value of $b_v=0.85\pm0.05$, comparable to the
n-body estimate of $b_v=0.8\pm0.1$. This particular value will remain tentative
until more data are available.

1994} With $P(k)$ parametrized by $(\sigma_8, \Gamma)$, the likelihood function
peaks at $\sigma_8\simeq0.3$, $\Gamma\lesssim0.025$, indicating at face value
very strong large-scale power, though at a level incompatible with COBE\@.
There is, however, a ridge of likelihood such that more conventional power
spectra do not seem strongly disfavored. The likelihood calculated using as
data only the components of the bulk flow solution peaks at higher $\sigma_8$,
in agreement with other analyses, but is rather broad. The likelihood
incorporating both bulk flow and shear gives a different picture. The
components of the shear are all low, and this pulls the peak to lower
amplitudes as a compromise.
  The Lauer \& Postman velocity data alone are therefore {\em consistent}\/
with models with very strong large scale power which generates a large bulk
flow, but the small shear (which also probes fairly large scales) requires that
the power would have to be at {\em very}\/ large scales, which is strongly
disfavored by COBE\@. The velocity data also seem compatible with more
conventional $P(k)$ with $0.2\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim0.5$, and the likelihood is
peaked around $\sigma_8\sim1$, in which case the bulk flow is a moderate, but
not extreme, statistical fluctuation.
  Applying the same techniques to the data of \markcite{Riess, Press, \&
Kirshner 1995}, the results are quite different. The flow is not inconsistent
with the microwave dipole and we derive only an upper limit to the amplitude of
the power spectrum: $\sigma_8\lesssim1.5$ at roughly 99\%.

horizon (with trapped surfaces behind it). The data $d$ are regular and {\it
innociuous}, i.e. the data--surface $S$ does not contain any point of the
horizon or of the trapped surface area.
  We give auxiliary data on an auxiliary hypersurface $H$ and also on the star
boundary; then we solve Einstein's equations for perfect fluid in the future
and past of $H$. Our solution induces the above mentioned data $d$ on some
chosen spacelike hypersurface $S$ in the past of $H$. By construction $H$ turns
out to be the matter part of the horizon, once we attach a vacuum to our matter
spacetime. Obviously, from these data $d$ on $S$ it develops (into the future)
the event horizon $H$.
  We solve the constraint equations for the auxiliary data posed on the
null--surface $H$. This reduces the choice of these data to the choice of the
density $\rho$ and $R:=[\text{curvature}]^{-1/2}$. Our data fulfil positivity
of $\rho$, $2m/R=1$ (at the star boundary) and other properties. This is
archieved by an algorithm, which for given $\rho $ yields $R$ (from an input

create large domains of disoriented chiral condensates low-momentum
instabilities have to last for long enough periods of time. Our simulations
