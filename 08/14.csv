and Wagoner (1986) to a more general class of supernova model atmospheres,
using a simple fit to the effective continuum opacity produced by lines
(Wagoner, Perez, and Vasu 1991). At the low densities considered, the
populations of the excited states of hydrogen are governed mainly by
photoionization and recombination, and scattering dominates absorptive opacity.
We match the asymptotic expressions for the spectral energy density $\Jnu$ at
the photosphere, whose location at each frequency is determined by a
first-order calculation of the deviation of $\Jnu$ from the Planck function
$\Bnu$. The emergent spectral luminosity then assumes the form $ L_\nu = 4\pi^2
\r*^2 \zeta^2 \Bnu(T_p) $, where $T_p(\nu)$ is the photospheric temperature,
$\zeta$ is the dilution factor, and $\r*$ is a fiducial radius [ultimately
taken to be the photospheric radius $r_p (\nu)$]. The atmosphere is
characterized by an effective temperature $T_e$ ($\propto L^{1/4} r_*^{-1/2}$)
and hydrogen density $n_H=n_* (r_*/r)^\alpha$ ; and less strongly by the heavy
element abundance and velocity gradient. Our major result is the dependence of
$\zeta$ on frequency $\nu$ and the parameters $T_p$, $r_p$, and $\alpha$.

magnetic flux tubes. Our analysis is restricted to direct collisions between
parallel tubes and is based on the collision dynamics worked out by Bogdan
(1984). We show that there is a range of collision velocities for which neutral
point reconnection of the Parker-Sweet type can occur, and a smaller range for
which reconnection leads to coalescence. Mean velocities within the solar
convection zone are probably significantly greater than the upper limit for
coalescence. This suggests that the majority of flux tube collisions do not
result in merging, unless the frictional coupling of the tubes to the
background flow is extremely strong.

fraction of galaxies, may be the least luminous manifestation of quasar
activity. The nature of LINERs has, however, remained controversial because an
AGN-like nonstellar continuum source has not been directly observed in them. We
report the detection of bright, unresolved (FWHM $\ltorder 0.1''$) point
sources of UV ($\sim 2300$ \AA) emission in the nuclei of nine nearby galaxies
from a complete sample of 110 nearby galaxies imaged with {\it HST}.
Ground-based optical spectroscopy reveals that five of the nuclei are LINERs,
three are starburst nuclei, and one is a Seyfert nucleus. The observed UV flux
in each of the five LINERs implies an ionizing flux that is sufficient to
account for the observed emission lines through photoionization. The detection
of a strong UV continuum in the LINERs argues against shock excitation as the
source of the observed emission lines, and supports the idea that
photoionization excites the lines in at least some objects of this class. Among
the Northern-hemisphere galaxies in the sample, 26 are LINERs, of which only
the above five LINERs have a detected nuclear UV source. There are no obvious
differences in the optical line intensity ratios between the UV-bright and
UV-dark LINERs. If all LINERs are photoionized, then the continuum source is
unobscured along our line of sight in $5/26\approx 20\%$ of LINERs.
Alternatively, spectrally-similar LINERs may be produced by various excitation
mechanisms, with photoionization responsible in only about 20\% of the cases.
The high angular resolution allows us to set upper limits, typically several
parsecs, on the physical size of the compact star-cluster or AGN-type continuum
source that is emitting the UV light in these objects.

rates for process $b \to s q\overline{q} $ (q=ud), $b\to s s\overline{s}$ and $
