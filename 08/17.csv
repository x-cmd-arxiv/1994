within the cluster to be detected individually. However, the light from these
``undetected'' galaxies still modulates the surface brightness of the
background sky. Clusters can appear as 10""-1.5' sized fluctuations in the
surface brightness of the EBL. The fluctuations have central surface
brightnesses between roughly 26 and 28 mag/sqr-arcsec (in V) for clusters
between z=1 and z=2, and are brighter than the fluctuations produced by
background field galaxies. While such low surface brightnesses are difficult to
achieve with direct high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that they are
easily reached in short exposures through smoothing the sky in very flat CCD
images. For a reasonable extrapolation of the properties and space densities of
clusters and groups, we find that for a wide range of cosmological assumptions
there should be tens of clusters per square degree visible in the extragalactic
background. The detection rate can range between 0.1 and 100 clusters per
square degree, for extreme assumptions about the rate of cluster and galaxy
evolution. Drift scans provide sufficient accuracy of flat-fielding to make the
method discussed in this paper an efficient techinque for finding candidate
high redshift clusters.

newly-formed, rapidly rotating neutron star. The neutron star may arise from
core collapse in a massive star or from the accretion-induced collapse of a

into an axisymmetric, secularly unstable equilibrium state. Gravitational
radiation drives the star to a nonaxisymmetric, stationary equilibrium
configuration via the bar-mode instability. The emitted quasi-periodic
gravitational waves have a unique signature: the wave frequency sweeps downward
from a few hundred Hertz to zero, while the wave amplitude increases from zero
to a maximum and then decays back to zero. Such a wave signal could be detected
by broad-band gravitational wave interferometers currently being constructed.
  We also characterize two other types of gravitational wave signals that could
arise in principle from a rapidly rotating, secularly unstable neutron star: a
high-frequency ($f\go 1000$ Hz) wave which increases the pattern-speed of the
star, and a wave that actually increases the angular momentum of the star.

dimensions to study the coalescence of binary neutron stars driven by the
emission of gravitational waves. The stars are modeled as compressible
ellipsoids obeying a polytropic equation of state; all internal fluid
velocities are assumed to be linear functions of the coordinates. The
hydrodynamic equations then reduce to a set of coupled ordinary differential
equations for the evolution of the principal axes of the ellipsoids, the
internal velocity parameters and the binary orbital parameters. Gravitational
radiation reaction and viscous dissipation are both incorporated. We set up
exact initial binary equilibrium configurations and follow the transition from
the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation to the rapid
dynamical evolution of the configurations just prior to contact. A
hydrodynamical instability resulting from tidal interactions significantly
accelerates the coalescence at small separation, leading to appreciable radial
infall velocity and tidal lag angles near contact. This behavior is reflected
in the gravitational waveforms and may be observable by gravitational wave
detectors under construction.

for the averaged J-point correlation functions, $\xibar_J$, with the results of
numerical simulations of gravitational clustering. We have carried out a
systematic analysis of this method using ensembles of simulations with
different numbers of particles, different box sizes and using different
particle arrangements and clustering amplitudes in the initial conditions. We
estimate $\xibar_J$, for $J=2-10$, from moments of counts-in-cells. We find
significant non-linear effects in the variance, $J=2$, even at scales as large
as $R \sim 30 \Mpc$. Perturbation theory gives remarkable agreement at large
scales, where $\xibar_2 \simlt 1$, with the measured hierarchical amplitudes
$S_J=\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$. We have followed the evolution of $\xibar_J$ in
time and find that for a change in the effective redshift of at least $\Delta z
\simeq 2$ the amplitudes $S_J$ remain unchanged, despite the fact that the
$\xibar_J$ have evolved by large factors, $\simeq 10^{J-1}$. We illustrate how
these results can be applied to interpret the clustering in galaxy surveys and
conclude that the observed hierarchical pattern in the APM is compatible with
gravitational evolution in unbiased, initially Gaussian, models.

mixing and diffusion is studied by calculating a number of calibrated solar
models. The rotational mixing inhibits the diffusion in the outer parts of the
models, leading to a decrease in the envelope diffusion by 25 -- 50\%.
Conversely, diffusion leads to gradients in mean molecular weight which can
inhibit the rotational mixing. The degree to which gradients in mean molecular
weight inhibits the rotational mixing is somewhat uncertain. A comparison to
the observed solar oblateness suggests that gradients in the mean molecular
weight play a smaller role in inhibiting the rotational mixing previously
believed. This is reinforced by the fact that the model with the standard value
for the inhibiting effect of mean molecular weight on the rotational mixing
depletes no Li on the main sequence. This is in clear contrast to the
observations. A reduction in the inhibiting effect of mean molecular weight
gradients by a factor of ten leads to noticeable main sequence Li depletion.

relations and the usual assumptions of analyticity. We suggest that this should
be possible for the higher point massless amplitudes as well.

on a topologically nontrivial manifold even if it is a finite-dimensional
manifold. In this paper we consider the abelian sigma model in (1+1) dimensions
to explore a system having infinite degrees of freedom. The model has a field
variable $ \phi : S^1 \to S^1 $. An algebra of the quantum field is defined
respecting the topological aspect of this model. A central extension of the
algebra is also introduced. It is shown that there exist an infinite number of
unitary inequivalent representations, which are characterized by a central
extension and a continuous parameter $ \alpha $ $ ( 0 \le \alpha < 1 ) $. When
the central extension exists, the winding operator and the zero-mode momentum
obey a nontrivial commutator.

Hamiltonian Chern Simons theory advertised in \cite{AGS}. Using the theory of
quantum Wilson lines, we show how the Verlinde algebra appears within the
context of quantum group gauge theory. This allows to discuss flatness of
quantum connections so that we can give a mathe- matically rigorous definition
of the algebra of observables $\A_{CS}$ of the Chern Simons model. It is a
*-algebra of ``functions on the quantum moduli space of flat connections'' and
comes equipped with a positive functional $\omega$ (``integration''). We prove
that this data does not depend on the particular choices which have been made
in the construction. Following ideas of Fock and Rosly \cite{FoRo}, the algebra
$\A_{CS}$ provides a deformation quantization of the algebra of functions on
the moduli space along the natural Poisson bracket induced by the Chern Simons
action. We evaluate a volume of the quantized moduli space and prove that it
coincides with the Verlinde number. This answer is also interpreted as a
partition partition function of the lattice Yang-Mills theory corresponding to
a quantum gauge group.

in energetic reactions of heavy nuclei, are analyzed, together with their
effects on emitted light baryons and pions. Within transport simulations, it is
shown that shock fronts perpendicular to beam axis form in head-on reactions.
The fronts separate hot compressed matter from normal. As impact parameter
increases, the angle of inclination of the fronts relative to beam axis
decreases, and in-between the fronts a weak tangential discontinuity develops.
Hot matter exposed to the vacuum in directions perpendicular to shock motion
(and parallel to fronts), starts to expand sideways, early within reactions.
Expansion in the direction of shock motion follows after the shocks propagate
through nuclei, but due to the delay does not acquire same strength. Expansion
affects angular distributions, mean-energy components, shapes of spectra and
mean energies of different particles emitted into any one direction, and
further particle yields. Both the expansion and a collective motion associated
with the weak discontinuity, affect the magnitude of sideward flow within
reaction plane. Differences in mean particle energy components in and out of
the reaction plane in semicentral collisions, depend sensitively on the
relative magnitude of shock speed in normal matter and speed of sound in hot
matter.
