inflicted on photons by a network of cosmic strings we show how to construct
the general q-point temperature correlation function of the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation. Our analysis is sensible specially for large angular
scales where the Kaiser-Stebbins effect is dominant. Then we concentrate our
study on the four-point function and in particular on its zero-lag limit,
namely, the excess kurtosis parameter, for which we obtain a predicted value of
$\sim 10^{-2}$. In addition, we estimate the cosmic variance for the kurtosis
due to a Gaussian fluctuation field, showing its dependence on the primordial
spectral index of density fluctuations $n$ and finding agreement with previous
published results for the particular case of a flat Harrison-Zel'dovich
spectrum. Our value for the kurtosis compares well with previous analyses but
falls below the threshold imposed by the cosmic variance when commonly accepted
parameters from string simulations are considered. In particular the
non-Gaussian signal is found to be inversely proportional to the scaling number
of defects, as could be expected by the central limit theorem.

  rafi@goshawk.lanl.gov",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.50.2952",,"cond-mat",,"  A statistical theory of two-dimensional Laplacian growths is formulated from
first-principles. First the area enclosed by the growing surface is mapped
conformally to the interior of the unit circle, generating a set of dynamically
evolving quasi-particles. Then it is shown that the evolution of a
surface-tension-free growing surface is Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian
formulation allows a natural extension of the formalism to growths with either
isotropic or anisotropic surface tension. It is shown that the curvature term
can be included as a surface energy in the Hamiltonian that gives rise to
repulsion between the quasi-particles and the surface. This repulsion prevents
cusp singularities from forming along the surface at any finite time and
regularizes the growth. An explicit example is computed to demonstrate the
regularizing effect. Noise is then introduced as in traditional statistical
mechanical formalism and a measure is defined that allows analysis of the
spatial distribution of the quasi-particles. Finally, a relation is derived
between this distribution and the growth probability along the growing surface.
Since the spatial distribution of quasi-particles flows to a stable limiting
form, this immediately translates into predictability of the asymptotic
morphology of the surface. An exactly-solvable class of arbitrary initial
conditions is analysed explicitly.
