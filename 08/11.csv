Mixture-modeling algorithms similar to the KMM algorithm have been used in
previous studies to partition the stellar population of the Milky Way into
subsystems. We illustrate the broad applicability of KMM by analysing published
data on globular cluster metallicity distributions, velocity distributions of
galaxies in clusters, and burst durations of gamma-ray sources. PostScript

  OSU-TA-15/94",,"10.1086/187779",,"astro-ph",,"  Massive Compact Objects (Machos) are currently being discovered at
substantially higher rates than would be expected from standard models of known
stellar populations. To determine whether they are due to non-standard distri-
butions of known populations or to a heretofore unknown (`dark') population,
one must acquire more information about the individual events. Space-based
parallaxes are potentially the best tool for extracting additional information.
To leading order, parallax measurements by a single satellite result in a four-
fold degeneracy: two possible values of $\tilde v$ and two possible signs for
the component of motion perpendicular to the projected satellite-Earth vector.
It had been believed that a second satellite would be required to break this
degeneracy. I show that the velocity difference between the satellite and the
Earth allows one to partially or totally break the degeneracy using a single
satellite. For most Macho events it is possible to measure $\tilde v$ and
$\tilde r_e$. For some it is also possible to measure $\Phi$. The proposed
Space Infrared Telescope could measure $\sim 100$ parallaxes per year by
applying $\sim 400\,$hr of telescope time.

investigating the behavior of CH relative to CN. Of the 20 turn-off stars, 12
were found to be CN-strong while 8 appear to be CN-weak. This ratio of
CN-strong to CN-weak stars is similar to the ratios found among the more
luminous 47 Tuc stars and implies little change in the overall distribution of
CN with evolutionary state, although the present sample size is small. A
general anticorrelation between CN and CH is also observed in that the CN-weak
main-sequence stars all (with one possible exception) exhibit strong CH bands -
a trend similar to that found among the brighter stars. That these variations
occur among such relatively un-evolved stars and that the overall CN
distribution appears to be independent of evolutionary state presents serious
challenges to internal or mixing theories of their origin. We therefore suggest
that at least some component of the C and N abundance inhomogeneities observed
