astigmatic lens: a power-law mass distribution: m \propto r^\beta with an
external shear \gamma. The image positions can be reproduced with an accuracy
better than 0.01 arcsec for any 0.0 < \beta < 1.85 and the corresponding value
of \gamma = 0.1385 - 0.0689 \beta. This is a factor of about 4 more precise
than what can be achieved by the best constant M/L lens models. The image
intensity ratios and the time delay ratios are almost constant along our one
parameter family of models, but the total magnification varies from 8 to >
1000, and the maximum time delay (between leading image B and trailing image C)
for H_0 of 75 km/sec/Mpc varies from more than 20 hours to about 1.5 hours,
while \beta increases from 0.0 to 1.85.

the group of gauge transformations and also from the topological cohomology of
the group of connections modulo gauge transformations. We show how these two
approaches are unified by the transgression map. We discuss the geometry behind
the current commutator anomaly and the Faddeev- Mickelsson anomaly using the
recent notion of a gerbe. Some anomalies (notably 3-cocycles) do not have such
a geometric origin. We discuss one example and a conjecture on how these may be
related to geometric anomalies.

tachyon field is added as a marginal operator. Due to this operator added, we
must further add the higher order corrections, which modifies the original
configuration, to make the theory full-conformally invariant. It has been found
that 2d is a critical dimension in the sense that the metric obtained from
gauged WZW is modified by the tachyon condensation for $d>2$, but not for $d\le
2$.

is defined by the new valley equation, which enables consistent evaluation of
the imaginary-time path-integral. We study the structure of this new valley
equation and solve these equations numerically. The valley is shown to contain
the bounce solution, as well as other bubble structures. We find that even when
the bubble solution has thick wall, the outer region of the valley is made of
large-radius, thin-wall bubble, which interior is occupied by the true-vacuum.
Smaller size bubbles, which contribute to decay at higher energies, are also
identified.

  Theorem 1: For rational polygons, periodic points of the billiard flow are
dense in the phase space of the billiard flow.
  This is a strengthening of Masur's theorem, who has shown that any rational
polygon has ``many'' periodic billiard trajectories; more precisely, the set of
directions of the periodic trajectories are dense in the set of velocity
directions $\S^1.$ We will also prove some refinements of Theorem 1: the ``well
distribution'' of periodic orbits in the polygon and the residuality of the
points $q \in Q$ with a dense set of periodic directions.
