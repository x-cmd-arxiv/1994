anisotropy expected from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models at 0.5 and 1.0 degree
angular resolution. Statistical properties of the maps are presented as a
function of sky coverage, angular resolution, and instrument noise, and the
implications of these results for observability of the Doppler peak are
discussed. The rms fluctuations in a map are not a particularly robust probe of
the existence of a Doppler peak, however, a full correlation analysis can
provide reasonable sensitivity. We find that sensitivity to the Doppler peak
depends primarily on the fraction of sky covered, and only secondarily on the
angular resolution and noise level. Color plates and one-dimensional scans of
the maps are presented to visually illustrate the anisotropies.

  submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters, August 12, 1994",,,,"astro-ph",,"  High-contrast peaks in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy can
appear as unresolved sources to observers. We fit simulated CMB maps generated
with a cold dark matter model to a set of unresolved features at instrumental
resolution 0.5 degrees to 1.5 degrees and present the integral density per
steradian n(>|T|) of unresolved features brighter than threshold temperature
|T|. A typical medium-scale experiment observing 0.001 sr at 0.5 degree
resolution would expect to observe one unresolved feature brighter than 85 \muK
after convolution with the beam profile, with less than 5% probability to
observe a source brighter than 150 \muK. Increasing the power-law index of
primordial density perturbations n from 1 to 1.5 raises these temperature
limits |T| by a factor of 2. The results are only weakly dependent on the
assumed values of the Hubble constant and baryon density.

spectrum of the planetary nebula BD~+30$^{\circ}$3639. We calculate the
transfer process through absorption and scattering in a spherical-symmetric
multi-grain dust shell. The emission of transiently heated particles is taken
into account, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We obtain an
acceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the PAH infrared bands. At
submillimetre wavelengths the observed emission is larger than the model
predicts, indicating that large dust conglomerates (``f{}luffy grains'') may be
needed as an additional constituent. The fit favours a distance of $\ge 2
\,$kpc, which implies that BD~+30$^\circ$3639 has evolved from a massive
progenitor of several solar masses. A low dust-to-gas mass ratio is found in
the ionised region. The calculations yield an original mass-loss rate of
$2\times10^{-4} \msolar \peryr$ on the Asymptotic Giant Branch. Using this
mass-loss rate, we calculate how the infrared spectrum has evolved during the
post-AGB evolution. We show in particular the evolution of the IRAS colours
during the preceding post-AGB evolution.

in the presence of quantal electronic transitions presented many years ago by
Pechukas can be localized in time using time dependent perturbation theory to
give an impulsive force which acts when trajectories hop between electronic
surfaces. The action of this impulsive force is completely equivalent to
adjusting the nuclear velocities in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling
vector so as to conserve energy, a procedure which is widely used in surface
hopping trajectory methods. This is the first time the precise connection
between these two formulations of the nonadiabatic dynamics problem has been
considered. We also demonstrate that the stationary phase approximation to the
reduced propagator at the heart of Pechukas' theory is not unitary due to its
neglect of nonstationary paths. As such mixed quantum-classical evolution
schemes based on this approximation are not norm conserving and in general must
fail to give the correct branching between different competing electronic
states. Tully's phase coherent, fewest switches branching algorithm is
guaranteed to conserve the norm. The branching between different alternatives
predicted by this approach, however, may be inaccurate, due to use of the
approximate local dynamics. We explore the relative merits of these different
approximations using Tully's 1D two state example scattering problems for which
numerically exact results are easily obtained.

$\nu_{\tau_R}$ is heavier than 2 GeV so that this particular version of the
