Comparisons are made between an approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi
equations, governing the evolution of the Hubble parameter, and the usual
scenario based on the evolution of the potential energy density. The vital role
of the inflationary attractor solution is emphasised, and some of its
properties described. We propose a new measure of inflation, based upon
contraction of the comoving Hubble length as opposed to the usual e-foldings of
physical expansion, and derive relevant formulae. We introduce an infinite
hierarchy of slow-roll parameters, and show that only a finite number of them
are required to produce results to a given order. The extension of the
slow-roll approximation into an analytic slow-roll expansion, converging on the
exact solution, is provided. Its role in calculations of inflationary dynamics
is discussed. We explore rational-approximants as a method of extending the
range of convergence of the slow-roll expansion up to, and beyond, the end of
inflation.

the Zel'dovich Approximation (ZA) and also appear in hierarchical N-body
simulations. We find that we can predict the orientation and position of N-body
simulation objects rather well, with decreasing accuracy for increasing
large-$k$ (small scale) power in the initial conditions. We examined an N-body
simulation with initial power spectrum $P(k) \propto k^3$, and found that a
modified version of ZA based on the smoothed initial potential worked well in
this extreme hierarchical case, implying that even here very low-amplitude long
waves dominate over local clumps (although we can see the beginning of the
breakdown expected for $k^4$). In this case the correlation length of the
initial potential is extremely small initially, but grows considerably as the
simulation evolves. We show that the nonlinear gravitational potential strongly
resembles the smoothed initial potential. This explains why ZA with smoothed
initial conditions reproduces large-scale structure so well, and probably why
our Universe has a coherent large-scale structure.

In it we showed that the dipole moment of the sphaleron has its origin in two
components: a ring of electric current circulating around the edge of the
sphaleron; and also two regions of opposite magnetic charge above and below the
ring. This magnetic charge has a partly topological explanation, arising from
the fact that the sphaleron is axisymmetric and parity invariant. Here, I
discuss the definition of the electromagnetic field and its sources in the
Standard Model, comparing the one we use with the better-known one of 't Hooft.
I also discuss the resemblance between the sphaleron and Nambu's ``dumb-bell''
-- a segment of $Z$-string which connects a monopole to an antimonopole.

the KM model with a logarithmic potential to examine its critical behavior. I
find critical lines associated with gamma_{string}=-1/2 and gamma_{string}=0 as
well as a tri-critical point associated with a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition. The continuum theories are constructed expanding around the
critical points. The one associated with gamma_{string}=0 coincides with the
standard d=1 string while the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition separates it
from that with gamma_{string}=-1/2 which is indistinguishable from pure 2D
gravity for local observables but has a continuum limit for correlators of
extended Wilson loops at large distances due to a singular behavior of the
Itzykson-Zuber correlator of the gauge fields. I reexamine the KM model with an
arbitrary potential in the large-D limit and show that it reduces at large N to
a one-matrix model whose potential is determined self-consistently. A relation
with discretized random surfaces is established via the gauged Potts model
which is equivalent to the KM model at large N providing the coordination
numbers coincide.

  A bicovariant differential calculus on IGL_qr(N) is explicitly obtained as a
projection from the one on GL_qr(N+1). Our procedure unifies in a single

and allows to deduce without effort the differential calculus on the q-plane
