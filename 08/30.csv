the observable distortion of background galaxies. The distortion measures the
combination $\gamma/(1-\kappa)$ of shear $\gamma$ and surface density $\kappa$.
From this we obtain an expression for the gradient of $\log (1 - \kappa)$ in
terms of directly measurable quantities. This allows one to reconstruct $1 -
\kappa$ up to an arbitrary constant multiplier. Recent work has emphasised an
ambiguity in the relation between the distortion and $\gamma/(1-\kappa)$. Here
we show that the functional relation depends only on the parity of the images,
so if one has data extending to large radii, and if the critical lines can be
visually identified (as lines along which the distortion diverges), this
ambiguity is resolved. Moreover, we show that for a generic 2-dimensional lens
it is possible to locally determine the parity from the distortion. The
arbitrary multiplier, which may in fact take a different value in each region
bounded by the contour $\kappa = 1$, can be determined by requiring that the
mean surface excess vanish at large radii and that the gradient of $\kappa$
should be continuous across $\kappa = 1$. We show how these ideas might be
implemented to reconstruct the surface density, if necessary without use of the
data in regions where determination of the parity is insecure, and we show how
one can measure the mass contained within an aperture, again, if necessary,
without using data within the aperture.

There are two important length scales in such a problem: one is the pinning

destroyed by disorder. The other length $\xi_{cr}$ is the length below which
Coulomb interactions are not important and the system is behaving as a standard
Luttinger liquid with short-range interactions. We obtain the frequency and

with the $t-t^{\prime}-J$ model, the spin distortions and the spatial distri-
bution of carriers for the multiply-doped systems will be related to the diffe-
rent ground states' single-hole quasiparticles. The low doping limit of the
hole-doped material corresponds to $\vec k = (\pi/2,\pi/2)$ quasiparticles,
states that generate so-called Shraiman-Siggia long-ranged dipolar spin distor-
tions via backflow. We propose that for the electron-doped materials the
single- hole ground state corresponds to $\vec k = (\pi,0)$ quasiparticles; we
show that the spin distortions generated by such carriers are short-ranged.
Then, we demonstrate the effect of this single-carrier difference in
many-carrier ground states via exact diagonalization results by evaluating
$S(\vec q)$ for up to 4 carriers in small clusters. Also, the different
single-carrier quasiparticles generate important differences in the spatial
distributions: for the hole-doped material the quasiparticles tend to stay far
apart from one another, whereas for the electron-doped material we find
tendencies consistent with the clustering of carriers, and possibly of
low-energy fluctuations into an electronic phase separated state. Lastly, we
propose the extrapolation of an approach based on the $t-t^{\prime}-J$ model to

the susceptibility has a divergent singularity of the form $\chi \sim

$A_s'$ is calculated. Other critical exponents are found to be
$\alpha_s'=\alpha_s=0$ and $\beta_s=1/4$, so that the scaling relation
$\alpha_s'+2\beta_s+\gamma_s'=2$ is satisfied. However, using exact results for
$\beta_s$ on the square, triangular, and honeycomb lattices, we show that
universality is violated at this singularity: $\beta_s$ is lattice-dependent.
Finally, from an analysis of spin-spin correlation functions, we demonstrate
that the correlation length and hence susceptibility are finite as one
approaches the point $u=-1$ from within the symmetric phase. This is confirmed
by an explicit study of high-temperature series expansions.

of Yang-Mills theories which manifestly implement Gauss' law on physical
states. These variables have furthermore a geometrical meaning, and allow one
to uncover further constraints physical states must satisfy. For gauge group
$SU(2)$, the underlying geometry is Riemannian and based on the group $GL(3)$.
The formalism allows also for the inclusion of static color sources and the
extension to gauge groups $SU(N>2)$, both of which are discussed here.

non-abelian group G, which we call the $(A_{r},G)$-Toda theory, and its affine
extensions in terms of gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten actions with deformation
terms. In particular, the affine $(A_{1},SU(2))$-Toda theory describes the
integrable deformation of the minimal conformal theory for the critical Ising
model by the operator $\Phi_{(2,1)}$. We derive infinite conserved charges and
soliton solutions from the Lax pair of the affine $(A_{1}, SU(2))$-Toda theory.
Another type of integrable deformation which accounts for the
$\Phi_{(3,1)}$-deformation of the minimal model is also found in the gauged
Wess-Zumino-Witten context and its infinite conserved charges are given.

be approximated by motion on a finite dimensional manifold obtained from the
moduli space of SU(2) Yang-Mills instantons. Motivated by this work we describe
how similar results exist for other soliton and instanton systems. We describe
in detail two examples for the approximation of the infinite dimensional
dynamics of sine-Gordon solitons by finite dimensional dynamics on a manifold
obtained from instanton moduli. In the first example we use the moduli space of
CP1 instantons and in the second example we use the moduli space of SU(2)
Yang-Mills instantons. The metric and potential functions on these manifolds
are constructed and the resulting dynamics is compared with the explicit exact
soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon theory.
