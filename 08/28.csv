  available from first author. CSULA-94-12",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.50.17199",,"cond-mat",,"  We study the Laughlin wave function on the cylinder. We find it only
describes an incompressible fluid when the two lengths of the cylinder are
comparable. As the radius is made smaller at fixed area, we observe a
continuous transition to the charge density wave Tao-Thouless state. We also
present some exact properties of the wave function in its polynomial form. We
then study the edge excitations of the quantum Hall incompressible fluid
modeled by the Laughlin wave function. The exponent describing the fluctuation
of the edge predicted by recent theories is shown to be identical with
numerical calculations. In particular, for $\nu=1/3$, we obtain the occupation
amplitudes of edge state $n(k)$ for 4-10 electron size systems. When plotted as
a function of the scaled wave vector they become essentially free of
finite-size effects. The resulting curve obtains a very good agreement with the
appropriate infinite-size Calogero-Sutherland model occupation numbers.
Finally, we numerically obtain $n(k)$ of the edge excitations for some pairing
states which may be relevant to the $\nu=5/2$ incompressible Hall state.

properties of the state of a single quantum system and even the Schr\""odinger
wave itself. These measurements require a protection, sometimes due to an
additional procedure and sometimes due to the potential of the system itself.
The analysis of the protective measurements is presented and it is argued,
contrary to recent claims, that they measure the quantum state and not the
protective potential. Some other misunderstandings concerning our proposal are
clarified.

performed on pre- and post-selected quantum systems and the coupling to the
measuring device is weakened. The outcomes of weak measurements, ``weak
values'' are very different for the eigenvalues of the measured operators. The
weak values yield novel rich structure of the quantum world. Weak values help
explaining peculiar quantum phenomena and finding new effects which might have
practical applications.

  States","11 pages, REVTEX",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.2638",,"nucl-th",,"  We discuss the implications of a doorway state model for parity mixing in
compound nuclear states. We argue that in order to explain the tendency of
parity violating asymmetries measured in $^{233}$Th to have a common sign,
doorways that contribute to parity mixing must be found in the same energy
neighbourhood of the measured resonance. The mechanism of parity mixing in this
case of nearby doorways is closely related to the intermediate structure
observed in nuclear reactions in which compound states are excited. We note
that in the region of interest ($^{233}$Th) nuclei exhibit octupole
deformations which leads to the existence of nearby parity doublets. These
parity doublets are then used as doorways in a model for parity mixing. The
contribution of such mechanism is estimated in a simple model.
