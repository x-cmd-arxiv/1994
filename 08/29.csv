non-linear regime. For this purpose we use a number of statistical indicators
such as filamentary statistics, spectrum of overdense/underdense regions and
the void probability function, each of which probes a particular aspect of
gravitational clustering. We use these statistical indicators to discriminate
between different approximations to gravitational instability which we test
against N-body simulations. The approximations which we test are, the truncated
Zel'dovich approximation (TZ), the adhesion model (AM), and the frozen flow
(FF) and linear potential (LP) approximations. Of these we find that FF and LP
break down relatively early, soon after the non-linear length scale exceeds
$R_*$ -- the mean distance between peaks of the gravitational potential. The
reason for this break down is easy to understand, particles in FF are
constrained to follow the streamlines of the initial velocity field. Shell
crossing is absent in this case and structure gradually freezes as particles
begin to collect near minima of the gravitational potential. In LP particles
follow the lines of force of the primordial potential, oscillating about its
minima at late times when the non-linear length scale $k_{\rm NL}^{-1}\simeq
R_*$. Unlike FF and LP the adhesion model (and to some extent TZ) continues to
give accurate results even at late times when $k_{\rm NL}^{-1} \ge R_*$. This
is because both AM and TZ use

by performing a multipole expansion on the distribution of diffuse background

used to constrain the baryonic fraction of the halo gas, the quadrupole to
monopole ratio is a sensitive probe of the distribution of gas in the halo,
{\it i.e.} the degree of flattening of the gas distribution. The predicted
diffuse gamma ray flux is found to be very sensitive to the adopted cosmic ray
density distribution throughout the halo. If the cosmic rays are uniform, then
the upper bound on the gas fraction is $16.6\%$ regardless of the flattening of
the halo gas distribution. However, this bound can be weakened by taking into
account the removal of flux in and close to the galactic plane, especially for
a oblate ($e <1$) gas distribution. On the other hand, in the more realistic
situation that the cosmic rays linearly trace the smoothed halo mass (and halo
gas) distribution, then a stringent bound on the baryonic gas fraction in the

would be point-like sources. We have examined the nature of possible point
sources that were tentatively identified in a recent high frequency CBR
experiment with half-degree resolution (Cheng et al. 1994: MSAM).
  The effects of local foreground sources, including cold dust clouds, radio
sources and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to foreground rich clusters are
considered, and the effective spectral slopes of these various foreground
contaminations are calculated. Radio source emission and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect are ruled out as the explanation of the possible MSAM sources.
  Modeles are examined of extremely cold dust clouds which are located in the
solar neighborhood, the interstellar medium, the galactic halo or at
cosmological distances. We estimate the cloud mass and dust grain parameters,
and in particular the grain size distribution, that are required in order to
produce a detectable signal in an MSAM-type experiment. It is shown that cold
dust clouds can have an important effect on CBR experiments only if the clouds
are nearby, and located within a disc scale height of the solar neighborhood.
Cold dust emission remains a possible source of far-infrared signal at the
level of the detected CBR fluctuations on degree scales, but may be ruled out
if the dust emissivity index satisfies $\alpha = 1.5 \pm 0.5$ .

sections of (1+1) and (2+1) jets for all polarisations of the exchanged virtual
photon. In particular, the full angular correlations between the lepton and jet
momenta are implemented. The program permits the application of acceptance cuts
on all external momenta. For this purpose, the program creates an event record
accessible to the user program with all momenta in the laboratory frame and in
the center of momentum frame of the proton and the virtual photon. This option
is indispensable for phenomenological studies because of the strong dependence
of cross sections on phase space restrictions and the large uncertainty of
fragmentation corrections in the proton direction. Since PROJET uses the Monte
Carlo integration method for the evaluation of phase space integrals, the
weights of the generated events can be used to produce distributions of
observables related to jet momenta.
