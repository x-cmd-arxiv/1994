the deviations from the Standard Model predictions for the leptonic and
hadronic variables measured at LEP and for the decay rate $b\rightarrow

both, the cases of universal and non--universal soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters at high energies. In the first case, for any given value of the top
quark mass, the Higgs and sparticle spectra are completely determined as a
function of two soft supersymmetry breaking parameters. In the case of
non--universality, instead, the strong correlations between the sparticle
masses are relaxed, allowing a richer structure for the precision data
variables. We show, however, that the requirement that the low energy theory
proceeds from a grand unified theory with a local symmetry group including
$SU(5)$, strongly constrains the set of possible indirect experimental
signatures. As a general feature, whenever a significant deviation from the
Standard Model value of the precision data variables is predicted, a light
sparticle, visible at LEP2, appears in the spectrum.
