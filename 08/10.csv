dimension $n$. Demailly has introduced a very interesting invariant --- the
Seshadri constant $\epsilon(L,x)$ --- which in effect measures how positive $L$
is locally near a given point $x \in X$. For instance, Seshadri's criterion for
ampleness may be phrased as stating that $L$ is ample if and only if there
exists a positive number $e > 0$ such that $\epsilon(L,x) > e$ for all $x \in
X$, and if $L$ is VERY ample, then $\epsilon(L,x) \ge 1$ for every $x$. We
prove the somewhat surprising result that in each dimension $n$ there is a
uniform lower bound on the Seshadri constant of an ample line bundle $L$ at a
very general point of $X$. Specifically, $\epsilon(L,x) \ge (1/n) $ for all $x
\in X$ outside the union of countably many proper subvarieties of $X$. Examples
of Miranda show that there cannot exist a bound (independent of $X$ and $L$)
that holds at every point. The proof draws inspiration from two sources: first,
the arguments used to prove boundedness of Fano manifolds of Picard number one;
and secondly some of the geometric ideas involving zero-estimates appearing in
the work of Faltings and others on Diophantine approximation and transcendence
theory. We give some elementary applications of the main theorem to adjoint and
pluricanonical linear series.

the most massive halos are also considered as sites for galaxy groups, with a

the earlier conclusions of White et al. (1987) for the low amplitude (high

but that there are too many galaxies. We also show that the peak biasing method
does not accurately reproduce the results obtained using dense halos identified
in the simulations themselves. The COBE anisotropy implies a higher
normalization, resulting in problems with excessive pairwise galaxy velocity
dispersion unless a strong velocity bias is present. Although we confirm the
strong velocity bias of halos reported by Couchman \& Carlberg (1992), we show
that the galaxy motions are still too large on small scales. We find no
amplitude for which the CDM model can reconcile simultaneously the galaxy
correlation function, the low pairwise velocity dispersion, and the richness
distribution of groups and clusters. With the normalization implied by COBE,
the CDM spectrum has too much power on small scales if $\Omega=1$.

investigated at next-to-leading order through one-loop resummed perturbation
theory. At this order the gluon propagator appears to give rise to strong
deviations from a Yukawa form of screening. Generally, an oscillatory behavior
is found which asymptotically becomes repulsive, but in a gauge-dependent
manner. However, these features are strongly sensitive to the existence of
screening of static magnetic fields. It is shown that a small magnetic
screening mass can restore exponential screening with a gauge independent value
of the screening mass, which depends logarithmically on the magnitude of the
magnetic mass. Recent results obtained in temporal axial gauge, which instead
indicate an asymptotic (repulsive) power-law behavior of screening, are also
critically discussed. In order to arrive at a gauge-invariant treatment of
chromoelectric screening, Polyakov loop correlations are considered, both with
and without dynamical gauge symmetry breaking. Again a crucial sensitivity to
the scale of magnetic screening is found. A detailed comparison of the
perturbative results with recent high-precision lattice simulations of the

Since it is of interest to know the portion of the strength exhausted by the
coherent (ground state to ground state) transition, the total transition rate
to all final states must also be computed. This was done i) in RPA by
explicitly summing over all final states ii) in the context of the closure
approximation (using shell model and RPA for constructing the initial state)
and iii) in the context of nuclear matter mapped into nuclei via a local
density approximation. We found that, apart from small local oscillations, the
conversion rate keeps increasing from light to heavy nuclear elements. We also
find that the coherent mode is dominant (it exhausts more than 90\% of the sum
rule). Various gauge models are discussed. In general the predicted branching
ratio is much smaller compared to the present experimental limit.
