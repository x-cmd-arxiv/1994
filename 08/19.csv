  SUSSEX-AST 94/8-2",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  The standard model of large scale structure is considered, in which the
structure originates as a Gaussian adiabatic density perturbation with a nearly
scale invariant spectrum. The basic theoretical tool of cosmological
perturbation theory is described, as well as the possible origin of the density
perturbation as a vacuum fluctuation during inflation. Then, after normalising
the spectrum to fit the cosmic microwave background anisotropy measured by
COBE, some versions of the standard model are compared with a variety of data
coming from observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters. The recent COBE
analysis of G\'{o}rski and collaborators is used, which gives a significantly
higher normalization than earlier ones. The comparison with galaxy and cluster
data is done using linear theory, supplemented by the Press-Schechter formula
when discussing object abundances of rich clusters and of damped Lyman alpha
systems. By focussing on the smoothed density contrast as a function of scale,
the observational data can be conveniently illustrated on a single figure,
facilitating easy comparison with theory. The spectral index is constrained to
$0.6<n<1.1$, and in particle physics motivated models that predict significant
gravitational waves the lower limit is tightened to $0.8$. [To appear,

halos. We treat the dark matter as a collisionless fluid and the baryons as an
ideal gas. We include the effects of gravity, pressure gradients,
hydrodynamical shocks, and radiative energy losses, but we neglect star
formation. Our initial conditions assume a flat universe dominated by cold dark
matter with a mean baryon abundance of 10\% by mass. Typical halos form through
the merging of a few smaller systems which had themselves formed in a similar
manner at higher redshift. The gas collects at the bottom of dark matter
potential wells as soon as these are properly resolved by our simulations.
There it settles into cold, tightly bound disks, and it remains cold during
subsequent evolution. As their halos coalesce, these disks merge on a timescale
that is consistent with dynamical friction estimates based on their {\it total}
(gas + surrounding dark matter) mass. Both the merger rates of the disks and
their mass spectrum are in remarkably good agreement with recent analytic
models that describe the evolution of {\it dark halos} in a hierarchical
universe. This very simple model of galaxy formation suffers from serious
shortcomings. It predicts that most baryons should be locked up in galaxies,
whereas in the real universe most baryons are thought to lie outside visible
galaxies. In addition, it predicts the specific angular momentum of a disk to
be only about 20\% that of its surrounding halo, corresponding to a radius
smaller than that of observed spiral galaxy disks.

as the precession of the warp, or a warp in the equatorial plane of an
axisymmetric prolate halo) friction can excite a warp. The damping/excitation

most warps cannot be primordial; they must be maintained by some ongoing

radiative cooling on the gas are neglected. While many present-day clusters are
predicted to be undergoing mergers, the density profiles of those that are
approximately in equilibrium are all very similar, both for the gas and for the
dark matter. These profiles show no sign of a uniform density core and steepen
gradually from the centre outwards. The standard $\beta$-model is a reasonable
fit over most of the radius range observable in real clusters. However, the
value obtained for the slope parameter $\beta_f$ increases with the outermost
radius of the fit. Temperature profiles of different simulated clusters are
also similar. Typically the temperature is almost uniform in the regions which
emit most of the X-ray flux but drops at larger radii. The gas temperature and
dark matter velocity dispersion in equilibrium clusters give values of
$\beta_T\equiv \mu m_p\sigma_{DM}^2/kT$ which are consistent with unity
provided an X-ray emission-weighted temperature is used. Larger values of
$\beta_T$ are found in merging objects where there is a transient boost in the

stringent upperbound on the reheating temperature after the inflation. We find
that $T_R \lesssim (10^{10}-10^{12})$GeV for $m_{3/2}\sim (100\GEV - 1\TEV)$,
which is more stringent than the constraints in the previous works.

smooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces and compute the Chern
numbers of holomorphic curves on these hypersurfaces. As anticipated, the
results satisfy nontrivial integrality constraints. These examples differ from
those studied previously in that standard methods of algebraic geometry which
work in the ordinary projective space case for low degree curves are not
generally applicable. In the limited special cases in which they do work we can
get independent predictions, and we find agreement with our results.

parallels standard treatments of $e^-$-nucleus quasielastic scattering. For
$K^+$ scattering, new responses involving scalar contributions appear in
addition to the Coulomb (or longitudinal) and transverse $(e,e')$ responses
which are of vector character. We compute these responses using both nuclear
matter and finite nucleus versions of the Relativistic Hartree Approximation to
Quantum Hadrodynamics including RPA correlations. Overall agreement with
measured $(e,e')$ responses and new $K^+$ quasielastic scattering data for
$^{40}$Ca at $|\qs|=500$ MeV/c is good. Strong RPA quenching is essential for
agreement with the Coulomb response. This quenching is notably less for the
$K^+$ cross section even though the new scalar contributions are even more
strongly quenched than the vector contributions. We show that this
``differential quenching'' alters sensitive cancellations in the expression for
the $K^+$ cross section so that it is reduced much less than the individual
responses. We emphasize the role of the purely relativistic distinction between
vector and scalar contributions in obtaining an accurate and consistent
description of the $(e,e')$ and $K^+$ data within the framework of our nuclear
structure model.
