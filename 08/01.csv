about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all
possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB,
and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of
belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show
that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary
predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N
grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can
use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result
is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence,
but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the
limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates
seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the
connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These
observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of

interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually
extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant
pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse
processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the
first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing
any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can
achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to
understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information.
Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly
because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other
pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a
structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper
reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information
using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high

triangle, Aleksan, Dunietz and Kayser have proposed the modes of the type
$K^-D^+_s$, common to $B_s$ and $\bar{B}_s$. We point out that it is possible
to gain in statistics by a sum over all modes with ground state mesons in the
final state, i.e. $K^-D^+_s$, $K^{*-}D_+^s$, $K^-D^{*+}_s$, $K^{*-}D^{*+}_s$.
The delicate point is the relative phase of these different contributions to
the dilution factor $D$ of the time-dependent asymmetry. Each contribution to
$D$ is proportional to a product $F^{cb}$ $F^{ub}$ $f_{D_s}$ $f_K$ where $F$
denotes form factors and $f$ decay constants. Within a definite phase
convention, lattice calculations do not show any change in sign when
extrapolating to light quarks the form factors and decay constants. Then, we
can show that all modes contribute constructively to the dilution factor,
except the $P$-wave $K^{*-}D^{*+}_s$, which is small. Quark model arguments
based on wave function overlaps also confirm this stability in sign. By summing
over all these modes we find a gain of a factor 6 in statistics relatively to
$K^-D^+_s$. The dilution factor for the sum $D_{tot}$ is remarkably stable for
theoretical schemes that are not in very strong conflict with data on $B \to
\psi K(K^*)$ or extrapolated from semileptonic charm form factors, giving
$D_{tot} \geq 0.6$, always close to $D(K^- D^+_s)$.

that a ratio of form factors in exclusive $\Lambda_b$ decays (which is related
to the pole mass) is free from renormalon ambiguities regardless of the mass
used as the expansion parameter of HQET. The renormalon ambiguities also cancel
in inclusive heavy hadron decays. Finally, we demonstrate the cancellation of
