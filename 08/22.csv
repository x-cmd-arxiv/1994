the barriers for kink formation and migration are in good accordance with

for a given system is to relate a reference system to each atom, an effective
medium for which the total energy is known and then only calculate the energy
difference between the two systems. Using transferable potentials and densities
a pair potential is constructed which describe the electro-static and
exchange-correlation part of the energy difference. The remaining part, the
