that the ${\cal H}$-cohomology rings generalize the classical ``intersection

properties e.g.\, Gysin maps, projection formula and projective bundle
decomposition, of ${\cal H}$-cohomology are obtained. We therefore obtain, for

Quillen $K$-theory to ${\cal H}$-cohomologies according with Gillet and

allows us to derive new relations between these estimates and constraints on
$\Omega_{baryon}$ and $N_{\nu}$. For example, only if the helium mass fraction,
$Y_p \ge .245$ does $^7$Li (or D) presently play a role in placing an upper
limit on the baryon density, and only if $Y_p \ge .250$ does $^4$He cease to
play a role in bounding $\etaten$. All the elements combine together tend to
give a stringent upper bound of $0.16$ on $\Omega_{baryon}$. We also find that
$Y_p$ must exceed .239 for consistency between theory and observation if
D+$^3$He/H is less than $ 10^{-4}$. Updated nuclear reaction rates, an updated
neutron half life, Monte Carlo techniques, and correlations between the
predicted abundances are incorporated in our analysis. We also discuss the

Hamiltonian systems and do not respect their characteristic properties, which
include the preservation of phase space volume with time. This can lead to
spurious damping or excitation. Methods that do preserve all the Hamiltonian
properties, i.e., for which the time-forward map is symplectic, are called
symplectic integration algorithms or SIAs. Although such integrators are
symplectic in theory, they are not symplectic if implemented using
finite-precision arithmetic. This paper explains how to eliminate this problem
by using ``Lattice SIAs'' and shows that these methods yield significant
advantages when the computational error is dominated by roundoff. Using a
lattice SIA is equivalent to evolving the exact solution of a problem with a
Hamiltonian that is slightly different from the original. Lattice methods are
useful for studies of the long-term evolution of Hamiltonian dynamical systems.
