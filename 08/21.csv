until the LHC is commissioned, it has the world's highest energy fixed target
beams, and Fermilab will be the leading high energy physics laboratory in the
US for the foreseeable future. Following the demise of the SSC, a number of
possible upgrades to the Tevatron complex, beyond construction of the Main
Injector, are being discussed. Using existing technology, it appears possible
to increase the luminosity of the $\bar{p}p$ Collider to at least
$10^{33}$cm$^{-2}$sec$^{-1}$ (Tevatron-Star) and to increase the beam energy to
2 TeV (DiTevatron). Fixed target beam of energy about 1.5 TeV could also be
delivered. Leaving the existing Tevatron in the tunnel and constructing
bypasses around the collider halls would allow simultaneous 800 GeV fixed
target and $\sqrt{s}$ = 4 TeV collider operation. These upgrades would give
Fermilab an exciting physics program which would be complementary to the LHC,
and they would lay the groundwork for the construction of a possible post-LHC
ultra-high energy hadron collider. (Presented at the Eighth Meeting of the
Division of Particles and Fields Albuquerque, New Mexico, August 2-6, 1994.)

via the static potential, that interpolates between 2-loop QCD in the UV and
the string prediction in the IR. Besides the usual $\Lam$-parameter and the
string tension, the coupling depends on one dimensionless parameter,
determining how fast the crossover from UV to IR behavior occurs (in principle
we know how to take into account any number of loops by adding more
parameters). Using a new Ansatz for the LATTICE potential in terms of the
continuum coupling, we can fit quenched and unquenched Monte Carlo results for
the potential down to ONE lattice spacing, and at the same time extract the
running coupling to high precision. We compare our Ansatz with 1-loop results
for the lattice potential, and use the coupling from our fits to quantitatively
check the accuracy of 2-loop evolution, compare with the Lepage-Mackenzie
estimate of the coupling extracted from the plaquette, and determine Sommer's
scale $r_0$ much more accurately than previously possible. For pure SU(3) we
find that the coupling scales on the percent level for $\beta\geq 6$.

CLEO data, leads to $V_{cd}/V_{cs}$ = $ 0.323 \pm 0.058$ and then, to: $\vert
V_{cs}\vert = 0.72\pm 0.10$. The prediction on the ratio of mixing angle is
(surprisingly) much higher than the value $0.226 \pm 0.004$ derived from the
unitarity constraint on the CKM matrix, while the corresponding value of $
V_{cs}$ is lower. These results can open a window for new physics, though a
stringent conclusion needs data with much higher statistics (from e.g tau-charm
factory) or/and alternative QCD-based estimates of the ratio of the
semileptonic form factors.

collaboration, $\mt =174 \pm 10 ^{+13}_{-12}$ GeV, we review and update the
constraints on the parameters of the quark flavour mixing matrix $V_{CKM}$ in
the standard model. In performing our fits, we use inputs from the measurements
of the following quantities: (i) $\abseps$, the CP-violating parameter in $K$
decays, (ii) $\delmd$, the mass difference due to the \bdbdbar\ mixing, (iii)
the matrix elements $\absvcb$ and $\absvub$, and (iv) $B$-hadron lifetimes. We
find that the allowed region of the unitarity triangle is very large, mostly
due to theoretical uncertainties. (This emphasizes the importance of
measurements of CP-violating rate asymmetries in the $B$ system.) Nevertheless,
the present data do somewhat restrict the allowed values of the coupling
constant product $f_{B_d}\sqrt{\hat{B}_{B_d}}$ and the renormalization-scale
invariant bag constant $\hat{B}_K$. With the updated CKM matrix we present the
currently-allowed range of the ratio $\vert V_{td}/V_{ts} \vert$, as well as
the standard model predictions for the \bsbsbar\ mixing parameter $\xs$ and the
quantities $\sin 2\alpha$, $\sin 2\beta$ and $\sin^2\gamma$, which characterize
the CP-asymmetries in $B$-decays. The ALEPH collaboration has recently reported
a significant improvement on the lower limit on the $\bs$-$\bsb$ mass
difference, $\Delta M_s/\Delta M_d > 11.3$ (95\% C.L.). This has interesting
consequences for the CKM parameters which are also worked out.
