supernova explosions by following the evolution of the cores of two massive
stars (15 Msun and 25 Msun) in two dimensions. Our calculations begin at the
onset of core collapse and stop several 100 ms after the bounce, at which time
successful explosions of the appropriate magnitude have been obtained. (...)
Guided by our numerical results, we have developed a paradigm for the supernova
explosion mechanism. We view a supernova as an open cycle thermodynamic engine
in which a reservoir of low-entropy matter (the envelope) is thermally coupled
and physically connected to a hot bath (the protoneutron star) by a neutrino
flux, and by hydrodynamic instabilities. (...) In essence, a Carnot cycle is
established in which convection allows out-of-equilibrium heat transfer
mediated by neutrinos to drive low entropy matter to higher entropy and
therefore extracts mechanical energy from the heat generated by gravitational
collapse. We argue that supernova explosions are nearly guaranteed and
self-regulated by the high efficiency of the thermodynamic engine. (...)
Convection continues to accumulate energy exterior to the neutron star until a
successful explosion has occurred. At this time, the envelope is expelled and
therefore uncoupled from the heat source (the neutron star) and the energy
input ceases. This paradigm does not invoke new or modified physics over
previous treatments, but relies on compellingly straightforward thermodynamic
arguments. It provides a robust and self-regulated explosion mechanism to power
supernovae which is effective under a wide range of physical parameters.

earth's atmosphere may provide a new method of studying energetic cosmic rays
with gamma-ray satellites. It is found that these cosmic ray interactions may
produce gamma-rays on millisecond time scales which may be detectable by
satellites. An extremely low gamma-ray background for transient gamma-ray
events and a large area of interaction, the earth's surface, make the scheme
plausible. The effective cross section of detection of interactions for cosmic
rays above 10^20 eV is found to be more than two orders of magnitude higher
than earth based detection techniques. This method may eventually offer an
efficient way of probing this region of the cosmic ray energy spectrum where
events are scarce. In this paper, a conceptual model is presented for the
production of short bursts of gamma-rays based on these grazing incidence
encounters with the earth's atmosphere.

presented by Crisanti, Amit and Gutfreund [3] ($\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf

slightly increased capacities as compared to the replica symmetric value

invariant action for Weyl and Weyl-like Cartan geometries outlined in a
previous paper. In addition to the familiar scalar curvature squared and
Maxwell terms, the action chosen contains the logarithmic derivative of the
scalar curvature combined with the intrinsic four vector (Weyl vector) in a
gauge invariant fashion. This introduces higher order derivative terms directly
into the action. No separate, ""matter"" fields are introduced. As the usual Weyl
metric and four vector are varied, certain gauge invariant combinations of
quantities arise naturally as the results are collected, provided the scalar
curvature is nonzero. This paper demonstrates the general validity of these
results for any gauge choice. Additionally, ""matter"" terms appear in the field
equations. Furthermore, the resulting forms isolate the familiar mathematical
structure of a coupled Einstein-Maxwell-Schroedinger (relativistic) system of
classical fields, with the exception of additional, second derivative terms in
the stress tensor for the Schroedinger field, and the algebraic independence of
the conjugate wavefunction. This independence is found to be equivalent to the
presence of a second, negative energy, Schroedinger field. A detailed
comparison is made between this model, and the standard
Einstein-Maxwell-Schroedinger field theory. The possible use of such continuum
models as a basis for quantum phenomena, and some generalizations of the model

investigate the implications of a heavy top quark mass, close to its infrared
fixed point, on the low energy parameters of the minimal supersymmetric
standard model. We use analytic expressions to calculate the Higgs masses as
well as the supersymmetric masses of the third generation. We further assume
bottom-tau unification at the GUT scale and examine the constraints put by this
condition on the parameter space ($\tan\beta$,$\alpha_3$), using the
renormalization group procedure at the two-loop level. We find only a small
fraction of the parameter space where the above conditions can be satisfied,
namely $1\le \tan\beta \le 2$, while $0.111\le\alpha_3(M_Z) \le 0.118$. We
further analyse the case where all three Yukawa couplings reach the
perturbative limit just after the unification scale. In this latter case, the
situation turns out to be very strict demanding $\tan\beta\sim 63$.

Witten (NW), correspond to (gauged) WZW models and thus have a direct conformal
field theory interpretation. A class of exact plane wave solutions (which
includes the NW solution) is constructed by `boosting' the twisted products of
two D=2 `cosmological' or `black-hole' cosets of SL(2,R) and SU(2). We describe
a general limiting procedure by which one can construct new solutions with a
covariantly constant null Killing vector starting with known string
backgrounds. By applying a non-abelian duality transformation to the NW model
we find a D=4 solution which has a covariantly constant null Killing vector but
is not a plane wave. Higher dimensional bosonic backgrounds with isometries can
be interpreted as lower dimensional backgrounds with extra gauge fields. Some
of them are at the same time solutions of the heterotic string theory. In
particular, the NW model represents also a D=3 `gravi-electromagnetic'
heterotic string plane wave. In addition to the (1,1) supersymmetric embeddings
of bosonic solutions we construct a number of non-trivial (1,0) supersymmetric
exact D=4 heterotic string plane wave solutions some of which are related (by a
boost and analytic continuation) to limiting cases of D=4 heterotic black hole
solutions.

makes sense in the real and in the complex case. In both settings we may, for
example, consider compact, nuclear, or $2$--summing operators, where the
definitions are adapted to each other in a natural way. This paper deals with
the question whether or not that fact is based on a general philosophy. Does
there exists a one--to--one correspondence between ``real properties'' and
``complex properties'' defining an operator ideal? In other words, does there
exist for every real operator ideal a uniquely determined corresponding complex
ideal and vice versa?
  Unfortunately, we are not abel to give a final answer. Nevertheless, some
preliminary results are obtained. In particular, we construct for every real
operator ideal a corresponding complex operator ideal and for every complex
operator ideal a corresponding real one. However, we conjecture that there
exists a complex operator ideal which can not be obtained from a real one by
this construction.
  The following approach is based on the observation that every complex Banach
space can be viewed as a real Banach space with an isometry acting on it like
the scalar multiplication by the imaginary unit $i$.
