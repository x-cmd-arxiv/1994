employs spherical harmonic decomposition. A common problem encountered in
practical astronomy is the lack of full sky coverage in the available data. For
example, the removal of the galactic plane data from the COBE DMR sky maps
compromises Fourier analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature distribution due to the loss of orthogonality of the spherical
harmonics. An explicit method for constructing orthonormal functions on an
incomplete (e.g. Galaxy-cut) sphere is presented. These functions should be
used in the proper Fourier analysis of the COBE DMR sky maps to provide the
correct input for the determination of the spectrum of primordial
inhomogeneity. The results of such an analysis are presented in an accompanying
Letter. A similar algebraic construction of appropriate functions can be
devised for other astronomical applications.

possible to enumerate all the maximally compact conformations, which are 3x3x3
cubes. This allows us to select sequences that have a unique global minimum. We
then explore the kinetics of collapse and folding and examine what features
determine the various rates. The folding time has a plateau over a broad range
of temperatures and diverges at both high and low temperatures. The folding
time depends on sequence and is related to the amount of energetic frustration
in the native state. The collapse times of the chains are sequence independent
and are a few orders of magnitude faster than the folding times, indicating a
two-phase folding process. Below a certain temperature the chains exhibit
glass-like behavior, characterized by a slowing down of time scales and loss of
self-averaging behavior. We explicitly define the glass transition temperature
(Tg), and by comparing it to the folding temperature (Tf), we find two classes
of sequences: good folders with Tf > Tg and non-folders with Tf < Tg.

scaling which arise in high-temperature superconductors, namely critical-point

of the zero-field critical point, thermodynamic functions scale with the
scaling variable $(T-T_{c2}(B))/B^{1/2\nu}$, which differs from the variable
$(T - T_c(0))/B^{1/2\nu}$ suggested by the gaussian approximation.
Lowest-Landau-level (LLL) scaling occurs in a region of high field surrounding
the upper critical field line but not in the vicinity of the zero-field
transition. For YBaCuO in particular, a field of at least 10 T is needed to
observe LLL scaling. These results are consistent with a range of recent

however, may be different.
  In this paper we develop a general formalism treating fluctuations around
circular strings embedded in arbitrary spatially flat FRW spacetimes. As
examples we consider Minkowski space, de Sitter space and power law expanding
universes. In the special case of power law inflation we find that in certain
cases the fluctuations grow much slower that the radius of the underlying

reduction to the symplectic submanifold $U_1=0$. This reduction gives rise to
matrix generalizations of (the classical version of) the {\it non-linear}

that these algebras contain a conformal Virasoro subalgebra and that
combinations $W_k$ of the $U_k$ can be formed that are $n\times n$-matrices of
conformally primary fields of spin $k$, in analogy with the scalar case $n=1$.
In general however, the $V_{m,n}$-algebras have a much richer structure than

equivalent to the summing basis.

subsequence.
  Combining the $c_0$-and $\ell^1$-theorems, one obtains
  Corollary 2. If $B$ is a non-reflexive Banach space such that $X^*$ is weakly
sequentially complete for all linear subspaces $X$ of $B$, then $c_0$ embeds in
$B$.

associated with a piecewise monotone map $f$ of the interval $[0,1]$ and a
weight function $g$. The analytic properties of $\zeta$ and the spectral
properties of $\scr L$ are related by a theorem of Baladi and Keller under an
assumption of ``generating partition''. It is shown here how to remove this
assumption and, in particular, extend the theorem of Baladi and Keller to the
case when $f$ has negative Schwarzian derivative.

  UI-NTH-9401",,"10.1063/1.48128",,"nucl-th",,"  The NONLOCAL Bonn-B potential predicts 8.0 MeV binding energy for the triton
(in a charge-dependent 34-channel Faddeev calculation) which is about 0.4 MeV
more than the predictions by LOCAL NN potentials. We pin down origin and size
of the nonlocality in the Bonn potential, in analytic and numeric form. The
nonlocality is due to the use of the correct off-shell Feynman amplitude of
one-boson-exchange avoiding the commonly used on-shell approximations which
yield the local potentials. We also illustrate how this off-shell behavior
leads to more binding energy. We emphasize that the increased binding energy is
not due to on-shell differences (differences in the fit of the NN data or phase
shifts). In particular, the Bonn-B potential reproduces accurately the
$\epsilon_1$ mixing parameter up to 350 MeV as determined in the recent
Nijmegen multi-energy NN phase-shift analysis. Adding the relativistic effect
from the relativistic nucleon propagators in the Faddeev equations, brings the
Bonn-B result up to 8.2 MeV triton binding. This leaves a difference of only
0.3 MeV to experiment, which may possibly be explained by refinements in the
treatment of relativity and the inclusion of other nonlocalities (e.~g.,
quark-gluon exchange at short range). Thus, it is conceivable that a realistic
NN potential which describes the NN data up to 300 MeV correctly may explain
the triton binding energy without recourse to 3-N forces; relativity would play
a major role for this result.
