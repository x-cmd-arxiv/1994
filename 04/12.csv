angular resolution and high dynamic range is a necessity. Coronography coupled
with adaptive optics on Hubble Space Telescope is a way to get both good
spatial resolution and high dynamic range. However, because of the residual
figure errors on the primary and on the secondary, HST has a scattered light
level that prevents it from detecting extra-solar planets. Our simulations show
that by using an active mirror (400-1000 actuators) in the optical path of HST
with adaptive optics, we can correct the mirror errors and decrease the
scattering level by a factor $10^{2}$ (from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$ fainter than
the star). Furthermore, by controlling the spatial frequencies of the active
mirror with a {\em dark hole\/} algorithm we can decrease the scattering level
in image zones where planet detection is likely. Using this technique, we have
succeeded in decreasing the scattering level to $3\times 10^{-8}$ of the star
intensity within 1 arcsec from the central star. This will allow the detection
of a Jupiter-like planet $10^{-9}$ times dimmer than the central star located
10 pc away in 1 hour of integration time with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.
This paper describes the method used to determine the actuator strokes applied
to a deformable mirror to achieve planet detection and the design of a
coronograph which implements this novel technique.

gravitational mass is negative, so will be the time delay (relative to null

closely an argument given by Penrose, Sorkin, and Woolgar, who treated the

is inconsistent with non-negative matter-energies in spacetimes having good
