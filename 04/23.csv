generate an unsteady relativistic wind that lasts for a few seconds. The wind
is likely to carry a high magnetic field; and its Lorentz factor depends on the
extent to which it is 'loaded' with baryons. If the Lorentz factor is $\sim
100$, internal dissipation and shocks in this wind produce a non-thermal
gamma-ray burst, detectable in the range $0.1\MeV \siml E_\gamma \siml
0.1-1\GeV$ out to cosmological distances. The cooled wind ejecta would
subsequently be decelerated by the external medium. The resultant blast wave
and reverse shock can then give rise to a second burst component, mainly
detectable in the GeV range, with a time delay relative to the MeV burst
ranging from minutes to hours.

(target fields) centered on optically bright galaxies, and the other seven
(blank fields) selected to contain no bright galaxies. We detected nine
previously uncataloged, gas-rich galaxies, six of them in the target fields. We
also detected HI from seven previously cataloged galaxies in these fields.
Observations in the void covered the same volume as the twelve supercluster
fields at the same HI-mass sensitivity, but no objects were detected. Combining
our HI data with optical broad-band and H-alpha imaging, we conclude that the
properties of HI-selected galaxies do not differ substantially from those of
late-type galaxies found in optical surveys. In particular, the galaxies in our
sample do not appear to be unusually faint for their HI mass, or for their
circular velocity. The previously cataloged, optically bright galaxies in our
survey volume dominate the total HI mass density and cross-section; the
uncataloged galaxies contribute only 19% of the mass and 12% of the
cross-section. Thus, existing estimates of the density and cross-section of
neutral hydrogen, most of which are based on optically-selected galaxy samples,
are probably accurate.

exact, and therefore is not restored in a true phase transition at finite
temperature, this second minimum can nevertheless mimic many of the effects of
a first order phase transition. We derive a lower limit on the height of the
second minimum relative to the global minimum based on cosmological
considerations; this limit is so weak as to be practically nonexistent. In high
energy nuclear collisions, it may lead to observable effects in Bose-Einstein
interferometry due to domain walls and to coherent pion emission.

vacuum, causes the instantons and antiinstantons to be screened over distances
of the order of 1/2 fm. Dilute instanton systems behave as a free gas, while
dense instanton systems behave as a plasma. The free gas behaviour is favored
by a density of 1 fm$^{-4}$. Owing to the Higgs mechanism, the $\eta$' mass is
heavy (1100 MeV). The vacuum topological susceptibility is small (0.07
fm$^{-4}$) and consistent with the QCD Ward identity. In the chiral limit, the
singlet screening vanishes, leading to a four dimensional plasma state with a
temperature given by the nonet decay constant $f$ (90 MeV). The phase is Debye
screened. In the presence of matter, the screening is quenched, and a
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition may occur signaling the restoration of the
$U_A(1)$ symmetry. We suggest to use the spatial asymptotics of the static
topological charge correlator together with the topological susceptibility to
probe the interplay between the $U_A(1)$ restoration and the chiral restoration
in finite temperature QCD. The relevance of these results to the bulk
thermodynamics in the instanton vacuum is discussed.
