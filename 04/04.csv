Anglo-Australian Telescope. The instrument combines non-redundant masking with
wavelength dispersion and is able to record fringes simultaneously over a wide
bandwidth. For typical observations centred near 600 nm, the bandwidth is 55 nm
and the spectral resolution is 3 nm. This paper describes the instrument and
the data processing methods and presents some results. We find the star sigma
Sgr to be a close binary; the system is only partially resolved, with a
separation of (11.5 +/- 2) milliarcsec (assuming the components to have equal
magnitudes). We also give angular diameter measurements of two red giant stars,
alpha Sco and beta Gru. The observations of beta Gru (spectral type M5 III)
resolve the star for the first time and give an equivalent uniform-disk
diameter of (27 +/- 3) milliarcsec.

important ramifications for a wide variety of uses of the formalism, from
syntactic analysis to semantic interpretation and statistical language
modeling. We argue that the definition of tree-adjoining derivation must be
reformulated in order to manifest the proper linguistic dependencies in
derivations. The particular proposal is both precisely characterizable through
a definition of TAG derivations as equivalence classes of ordered derivation
trees, and computationally operational, by virtue of a compilation to linear
indexed grammars together with an efficient algorithm for recognition and
parsing according to the compiled grammar.

  typographical changes only","Computational Intelligence 10(4):371-385, November 1994",,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  The formalism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars, a variant of standard
tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), was intended to allow the use of TAGs for
language transduction in addition to language specification. In previous work,
the definition of the transduction relation defined by a synchronous TAG was
given by appeal to an iterative rewriting process. The rewriting definition of
derivation is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the
formalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not
impossible. We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous
tree-adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard
tree-adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and implementability
problems of the original rewriting definition. The decrease in expressivity,
which would otherwise make the method unusable, is offset by the incorporation
of an alternative definition of standard tree-adjoining derivation, previously
proposed for completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to
entertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation. Nonetheless,
some remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the
definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed. It remains for
future research to tune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings.

structures which either are governed by isotropic scaling--laws
(``self--similarity'') or --- as in the case of directed percolation --- may
display anisotropic scaling behavior (``self--affinity''). Taking advantage of
the fact that both isotropic and directed bond percolation (with one preferred
direction) may be mapped onto corresponding variants of (Reggeon) field theory,
we discuss the crossover between self--similar and self--affine scaling. This
has been a long--standing and yet unsolved problem because it is accompanied by
different upper critical dimensions: $d_c^{\rm I} = 6$ for isotropic, and
$d_c^{\rm D} = 5$ for directed percolation, respectively. Using a generalized
subtraction scheme we show that this crossover may nevertheless be treated
consistently within the framework of renormalization group theory. We identify
the corresponding crossover exponent, and calculate effective exponents for
different length scales and the pair correlation function to one--loop order.
Thus we are able to predict at which characteristic anisotropy scale the
crossover should occur. The results are subject to direct tests by both
computer simulations and experiment. We emphasize the broad range of
applicability of the proposed method.

Together with explicitly realized Poincar\'e symmetry, the action functional
turns out to be invariant under two types of gauge transformations having their
origin in the presence of two Abelian first-class constraints in the Hamilton
formalism. These constraints correspond to strong conservation for the
phase-space counterparts of the Casimir operators of the Poincar\'e group.
Canonical quantization of the model leads to equations on the wave functions
