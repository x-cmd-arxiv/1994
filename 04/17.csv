  Found? - a Response","13pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In a recent paper Dar and Shaviv (1994) presented results of calculations
with an improved standard solar model (SSM) that suggest a standard physics
solution to the solar neutrino problem. In a subsequent publication with a
similar title Bahcall et al. (1994) have claimed to refute the results obtained
by Dar and Shaviv. Here we show that the criticism and conclusions of Bahcall
et al. are unjustified. In particular, their attempts to reproduce the results
of Dar and Shaviv failed because they did not use the same nuclear cross
sections and did not include in their calculations major physics improvements
which were included in the improved SSM code used by Dar and Shaviv.

polynomials on a hypersurface in C^3. The latter then carries a simple
singularity, which resolves by a finite iteration of basic cycles of
deprojections. The homological intersection graph of this cycles is the Dynkin
graph of an ADE Lie group. The deformation of the simple singularity
corresponds to ADE symmetry breaking. A 3+1-dimensional topological model of
observation is constructed, transforming consistently under SL(2,C), as an
evolving 3-dimensional system of world tubes, which connect ``possible points
of observation"". The existence of an initial singularity for the 4-dimensional
space-time is related to its global topological structure. Associating the
geometry of ADE singularities to the vertex structure of the topological model
puts forward the conjecture on a likewise relation of inner symmetries of
elementary particles to local space-time structure.

The locus of singular points on a given orbifold is equivalent to a link of
Wilson lines. This allows one to reduce any correlation function on orbifolds
to a sum of more complicated correlation functions in the simpler theory on
manifolds. Chern-Simons theory on manifolds is known to be related to 2D CFT on
closed string surfaces; here I show that the theory on orbifolds is related to
2D CFT of unoriented closed and open string models, i.e. to worldsheet orbifold
models. In particular, the boundary components of the worldsheet correspond to
the components of the singular locus in the 3D orbifold. This correspondence
leads to a simple identification of the open string spectra, including their
Chan-Paton degeneration, in terms of fusing Wilson lines in the corresponding
Chern-Simons theory. The correspondence is studied in detail, and some exactly
solvable examples are presented. Some of these examples indicate that it is
natural to think of the orbifold group $Z_2$ as a part of the gauge group of
the Chern-Simons theory, thus generalizing the standard definition of gauge
theories.
