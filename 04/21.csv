statistical performance of the Lagrangian perturbation schemes (whose
first--order solution contains as a subset the celebrated

the approximations at stages beyond the obvious validity of perturbation
theory. Recently, another series of tests of different analytical and
semi--numerical approximations for large--scale structure was conducted with
the result that ZA displays the best dynamical performance in comparison with
the N--body simulations, if the initial data were smoothed before evolving the
model, i.e., a truncated form of ZA (TZA). We show in this Letter that the
excellent performance of TZA can be further improved by going to second order
in the Lagrangian perturbation approach. The truncated second--order Lagrangian
scheme provides a useful improvement over TZA especially for negative power
indices, which suggests it will be very useful for modelling standard scenarios

invariant forms of the Lie superalgebra can be either degenerate or
non-degenerate. We give the conditions for a Virasoro construction, in which
the currents are primary fields of weight one, to exist. In certain cases, the
Virasoro central charge is an integer equal to the super dimension of the group
supermanifold. A Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action based on these Lie
superalgebras is also found.

be equiconsitent with the existence of a coherent sequence of measures with a
repeat point. However we prove that the Axiom of Full Reflection at a
measurable cardinal is surprisingly equiconsistent just with the existence of a
measurable cardinal. We also generalize the result to larger cardinals as
strong or supercompact. Hence we can conclude that the Axiom of Full Reflection
at large cardinals weaker than measurable, e.g. as n-Mahlo, does push the
consistency strength up, but does not push the consistency strength up at
measurable or larger cardinals.

the sequence of biorthogonal functionals of some $\alpha$-basis in $X$. Does
$M$ contain a sequence of biorthogonal functionals of some $\beta$-basis in
$X$?
  The following particular cases are considered:
  $(\alpha, \beta)$=(Schauder bases, unconditional bases),
  $(\alpha, \beta)$=(Nonlinear operational bases, linear operational bases).
  The paper contains an investigation of some of the spaces constructed by
S.Belle\-not in ``The $J$-sum of Banach spaces'', J. Funct. Anal. {\bf 48}
