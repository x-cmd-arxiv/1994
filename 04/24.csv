  cluster tidal field","20 pages, uuencoded compressed tarred postscript",,"10.1093/mnras/270.2.390",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate two possible effects of the tidal field induced by a spherical
cluster on its elliptical galaxy members: the modification of the ellipticity
of a spherical galaxy and the isophotal alignment in the cluster radial
direction of a misaligned prolate galaxy. Numerical N-body simulations have
been performed for radial and circular galactic orbits. The properties of the
stars' zero--velocity surfaces in the perturbed galaxies are explored briefly,
and the adiabaticity of the galaxy to the external field is discussed. For a
choice of parameters characteristic of rich clusters we find that the induced
ellipticity on a spherical galaxy is below or close to the detectability level.
But we find that the tidal torque can result in significant isophotal alignment
of the galaxies' major axis with the cluster radial direction if the galaxy is
outside the cluster core radius. The time required for the alignment is very
short compared with the Hubble time. A significant increase in the ellipticity
of the outer isophotes of the prolate model is also found, but with no
observable isophotal twisting. Our main prediction is an alignment segregation
of the elliptical galaxy population according to whether their orbits lie
mostly outside or inside the cluster core radius. These results also suggest
that galactic alignment in rich clusters is not incompatible with a bottom-up
galaxy formation scenario.

motivation for new neutrino physics comes from the complete phenomenological
failure of astrophysical solutions: (1) The standard solar model is excluded by
each of the solar neutrino experiments. (2) The combined results of Homestake
and Kamiokande are incompatible with any astrophysical solution. (3) Even if
the Homestake results were ignored entirely, there is no realistic solar model
so far that describes the Kamiokande and gallium data simultaneously within
their experimental uncertainties. On the other hand, the MSW solutions provide
a complete description of the data, strongly hinting at the existence of mass
and mixing of neutrinos. The MSW predictions for the future experiments are
given in detail. It is stressed that solar model uncertainties are significant
in determining the oscillation parameters and in making predictions for the
future experiments. Especially, a $^8$B flux (or $S_{17}$) smaller by 20\% than
that of the Bahcall-Pinsonneault model can make the interpretation of the
charged to neutral current ratio measurement in SNO ambiguous.

The geometry of folds is discussed and a metric on the space of folded maps is
written down. We show that the latter is not invariant under area preserving
diffeomorphisms of the target space. The contribution to the partition function
of maps associated with a given fold configuration is computed. We derive a
description of folds in terms of Feynman diagrams. A scheme to sum up the
contributions of folds to the partition function in a special case is suggested
and is shown to be related to the Baxter-Wu lattice model. An interpretation of
folds as trajectories of particles in the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$
gauge group in the large $N$ limit which interact in an unusual way with the
gauge fields is discussed.
