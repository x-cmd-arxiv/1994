quantum fields propagating in the black-hole's interior. The present paper
contains the further development of this approach. The no-boundary proposal
(analogous to the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal in quantum cosmology) is
put forward for defining the wave function of a black hole. This wave function
is a functional on the configuration space of physical fields (including the
gravitational one) on the three-dimensional space with the Einstein-Rosen
bridge topology.It is shown that in the limit of small perturbations on the
Kruskal background geometry the no-boundary wave function coincides with the
Hartle-Hawking vacuum state. The invariant definition of inside and outside
modes is proposed. The density matrix describing the internal state of a black
hole is obtained by averaging over the outside modes. This density matrix is
used to define the entropy of a black hole, which is to be divergent. It is
argued that the quantum fluctuations of the horizon which are internally
present in the proposed formalism may give the necessary cut-off and provide a
black hole with the finite entropy.

on a half-line is addressed. It is found, by examining low-spin conserved
charges, that the boundary conditions preserving integrability are strongly
constrained. In particular, for the $a_n\ (n>1)$ series of models there can be
no free parameters introduced by the boundary condition; indeed the only
remaining freedom (apart from choosing the simple condition $\partial_1\phi
=0$), resides in a choice of signs. For a special case of the boundary
condition, it is argued that the classical boundary bound state spectrum is
closely related to a consistent set of reflection factors in the quantum field
theory.

theories, whose correlators are intersection numbers of cohomology classes in a
constrained moduli space. Our specific example is a formulation of 2D
topological gravity. The constrained moduli-space is the Poincare' dual of the
top Chern-class of the bundle $E_\rightarrow {\cal M}_g$, whose sections are
the holomorphic differentials. Its complex dimension is $2g-3$, rather then
$3g-3$. We derive our model by performing the A-topological twist of N=2
supergravity, that we identify with N=2 Liouville theory, whose rheonomic
construction is also presented. The peculiar field theoretical mechanism,
rooted in BRST cohomology, that is responsible for the constraint on moduli
space is discussed, the key point being the fact that the graviphoton becomes a
Lagrange multiplier after twist. The relation with conformal field theories is
also explored. Our formulation of N=2 Liouville theory leads to a
representation of the N=2 superconformal algebra with $c=6$, instead of the
value $c=9$ that is obtained by untwisting the Verlinde and Verlinde
formulation of topological gravity. The reduced central charge is the shadow,
in conformal field theory, of the constraint on moduli space.

from the algebra of functions on quantum group to the algebra of sections of a
sheaf of algebras on a classical manifold as describing such a dependence. It
is argued that the functorial point of view of group schemes is more
appropriate in quantum group field theory. A sheaf of the Hopf algebras over
the manifold (quantum sheaf) is constructed by using bosonization formulas for
the algebra of functions on the quantum group $SU_{q}(2)$ and the theory of
repre- sentations of canonical commutation relations. A family of automorphisms
of the Hopf algebra depending on classical variables is described. Quantum
manifolds, i.e. manifolds with commutative and non-commutative coordinates are
discussed as a generalization of supermanifolds. Quantum group chiral fields
and relations with algebraic differential calculus are discussed.

noncommutative geometry. Any differential algebra on a discrete set can be
regarded as a `reduction' of the `universal differential algebra' and this
allows a systematic exploration of differential algebras on a given set.
Associated with a differential algebra is a (di)graph where two vertices are
connected by at most two (antiparallel) arrows. The interpretation of such a
graph as a `Hasse diagram' determining a (locally finite) topology then
establishes contact with recent work by other authors in which discretizations
of topological spaces and corresponding field theories were considered which
retain their global topological structure. It is shown that field theories, and
in particular gauge theories, can be formulated on a discrete set in close
analogy with the continuum case. The framework presented generalizes ordinary
lattice theory which is recovered from an oriented (hypercubic) lattice graph.
It also includes, e.g., the two-point space used by Connes and Lott (and
others) in models of elementary particle physics. The formalism suggests that
the latter be regarded as an approximation of a manifold and thus opens a way
to relate models with an `internal' discrete space ({\`a} la Connes et al.) to
models of dimensionally reduced gauge fields. Furthermore, also a `symmetric
lattice' is studied which (in a certain continuum limit) turns out to be
related to a `noncommutative differential calculus' on manifolds.

central charge c to a smaller algebra if the rank is high enough: Choosing a
suitable parametrization of the central charge in terms of the rank of the
underlying simple Lie algebra, the field content does not change with the rank
of the Casimir algebra any more. This leads to identifications between the
Casimir algebras themselves but also gives rise to new, `unifying' W-algebras.
For example, the kth unitary minimal model of WA_n has a unifying W-algebra of
type W(2,3,...,k^2 + 3 k + 1). These unifying W-algebras are non-freely
generated on the quantum level and belong to a recently discovered class of
W-algebras with infinitely, non-freely generated classical counterparts. Some
of the identifications are indicated by level-rank-duality leading to a coset
realization of these unifying W-algebras. Other unifying W-algebras are new,
including e.g. algebras of type WD_{-n}. We point out that all unifying quantum
W-algebras are finitely, but non-freely generated.
