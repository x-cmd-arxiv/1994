our new type of perturbations for one mode of fluctuations $\de\phi_k$ in the
scalar field. We generalize this analysis, considering the contribution from
the whole spectrum of $\de\phi$ to a given wavelength of geometrical
perturbations. Finally, we discuss the evolution of the perturbations during
the subsequent radiation dominated era and discuss the resulting spectrum of
density fluctuations. In the case of a massless scalar field we find a spectral
index $n=4$. For massive scalar fields we obtain $n=0$ but the resulting
amplitude of fluctuations for inflation around a GUT scale are by far too high.
Hence, 'conventional' inflationary models must not be influenced by this new
type of perturbations, in order to lead to acceptable matter and CMB

disordered than suggested by the average crystal structure. The Tl-Tl distance

\AA, significantly shorter than the distance calculated with both the Tl and
O(3) atoms at their ideal $4e$ sites ( $x=y=$0 or $\frac{1}{2}$). A model based
on these results shows that the Tl atom is displaced along the $<110>$
directions from its ideal site by about 0.11 \AA; the displacements of
neighboring Tl atoms are correlated. The O(3) atom is shifted from the $4e$

the Tl L$_{III}$-edge XAFS spectra from three samples, with T$_c$=60 K, 76 K,

while the Tl local displacement is insensitive to T$_c$ and the structural
symmetry. These conclusions are compared with other experimental results and
the implications for charge transfer and superconductivity are discussed. This

Majoron models as well as some SUSY models. The LEP signal and mass limit for a
Higgs particle undergoing invisible decay are explored. They are found to be
very similar to those for the standard model decay. The best signatures and

discussed.

and neutral-current electroweak interactions which in comparison with the
standard electroweak theory contains three free parameters $\Delta x, \Delta
y$, $\varepsilon$ which quantify different sources for violations of $SU(2)$
symmetry. Within the standard $SU(2)_I \times U(1)_Y$ electroweak theory, we
present both exact and very much refined approximate analytical one-loop
expressions for these parameters in terms of the canonical input, $G_\mu, \MZ$,
$\alpz$, the top-quark mass, $\Mt$, and the Higgs-boson mass, $\MH$. We
reemphase the importance of discriminating between the {\it empirically
well-known purely fermionic} (vacuum polarization) contributions to $\Delta x,
\Delta y$, $\varepsilon$ and the {\it empirically unknown bosonic} ones with
respect to present and future electroweak precision tests. The parameters
$\Delta x$ and $\varepsilon$ are hardly affected by standard bosonic
corrections, while the full one-loop results for $\Delta y$ differ appreciably
from the ones obtained by taking into account fermion loops only. A detailed
comparison with the experimental data on $\MWpm/\MZ$, $\bar\sw^2$, $\Gamma_l$
shows that these data start to become accurate enough to be sensitive to
standard (bosonic) contributions to $\Delta y$ beyond fermion loops.
