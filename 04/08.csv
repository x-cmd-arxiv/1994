Individual strategies may be either deterministic or stochastic. Strategy
success is measured according to some universal and unchanging criterion.
Successful strategies persist and spread; unsuccessful ones disappear. In this
thesis, two cellular game models are formally defined, and are compared to
cellular automata. Computer simulations of these models are presented.
Conditions providing maximal average cell success, on one and two-dimensional
lattices, are examined. It is shown that these conditions are not necessarily

Nash equilibrium strategies are not necessarily stable. Finally, a particular
kind of zero-depth, two-strategy cellular game is discussed; such a game is
called a simple cellular game. It is shown that if a simple cellular game is
left/right symmetric, and if there are initially only finitely many cells using
one strategy, the zone in which this strategy occurs has probability 0 of
expanding arbitrarily far in one direction only. With probability 1, it will
either expand in both directions or disappear. Computer simulations of such

This open model succeeds in matching local observations of clusters in contrast
to the standard $\Omega=1$, CDM model, which fails. It predicts an order of
magnitude decline in the number density of bright ($h\nu = 2-10$keV) clusters
from $z=0$ to $z=2$ in contrast to a slight increase in the number density for
standard $\Omega=1$, CDM model. This COBE-normalized CDM$+\Lambda$ model
produces approximately the same number of X-ray clusters having
$L_x>10^{43}$erg/s as observed. The number density of bright clusters increases
to $z\sim 0.2-0.5$ and declines, but the luminosity per typical cluster
decreases monotonically with redshift, with the result that the number density
of bright clusters shows a broad peak near $z=0.5$, and then a rapid decline as
$z\rightarrow 3$. The most interesting point which we find is that the
temperatures of clusters in this model freeze out at later times ($z\le 0.3$),
while previously we found in the CDM model that there was a steep increase
during the same interval of redshift. The trend should be detectable even with
a relatively ``soft"" X-ray instrument such as ROSAT, providing a powerful
discriminant between $\Omega=1$ and $\Omega<1$ models. Examining the ratio of
gas-to-total mass in the clusters, we find a slight antibias ($b=0.9$ or
$({\Omega_{gas}\over\Omega_{tot}})_{cl} =0.083\pm 0.007$), which is consistent
with observations [$({\Omega_{gas}\over\Omega_{tot}})_{obs}=0.097\pm 0.019$ for

approximately 5 times too much emission from clusters having

a new and independent argument for lower small scale power than standard CDM at
the $8h^{-1}$Mpc scale. The background radiation field at 1keV due to clusters
in this model is approximately $1/3$ of the observed background which, after
correction for numerical effects, again indicates approximately 5 times too

observed ratio of gas to total mass in clusters, rather than basing the mean

positive self-adjoint ones are defined throughthe zeta-function regularization.
We define a multiplicative anomaly as the ratio $\det(AB)/(\det(A)\det(B))$
considered as a functionon pairs of elliptic PDOs. We obtained an explicit
formula for the multiplicative anomaly in terms of symbols of operators. For a
certain natural classof PDOs on odd-dimensional manifolds generalizing the
class of ellipticdifferential operators, the multiplicative anomaly is
identically $1$. For elliptic PDOs from this class a holomorphic determinant
and a determinant for zero orders PDOs are introduced. Using various algebraic,
analytic, and topological tools we study local and global properties of the
multiplicative anomaly and of the determinant Lie group closely related with
it. The Lie algebra for the determinant Lie group has a description in terms of
symbols only. Our main discovery is that there is a {\em quadratic
non-linearity} hidden in the definition of determinants of PDOs through
zeta-functions. The natural explanation of this non-linearity follows from
complex-analytic properties of a new trace functional TR on PDOs of non-integer
orders. Using TR we easily reproduce known facts about noncommutative residues
of PDOs and obtain several new results. In particular, we describe a structure
of derivatives of zeta-functions at zero as of functions on logarithms of
elliptic PDOs. We propose several definitions extending zeta-regularized
determinants to general elliptic PDOs. For elliptic PDOs of nonzero complex
orders we introduce a canonical determinant in its natural domain of
definition.

multiloop infinite graphs with total valence in each vertex equal $p+1$. They
all are spaces of the constant negative curvature since they are quotients of
the $p$-adic hyperbolic plane over free acting discrete subgroup of $PGL(2,
{\bf Q}_p)$. Releasing the closed part of this graph containing all loops which
is called reduced graph $T_{red}$ we can obtain $L$-function corresponding to
this closed graph. For the total graph we introduce the notion of the spherical
functions being eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator acting on the graph and
consider $s$--wave scattering processes therefore defining scattering matrices
$c_i$. The number of possibilities coincides with $|\T_{red}|$ --- the number
of vertices of the reduced graph. Taking the product over all $c_i$ we define
the total scattering matrix which appears to be essentially presented as a
ratio of $L$--functions: $C\sim L(\alpha_+)/L(\alpha_-)$, where the function
$L$ itself depends only on the shape of $\Tr$ and not on the initial infinite
graph, and the only dependence of initial $p$ is contained in arguments
$\alpha_\pm$ defined by $p$ and eigenvalue $t$ of the Laplacian. We also
present a proof by H.Bass of the theorem expressing $L$--functions on arbitrary
finite graphs via determinants of some local operators on these graphs.
