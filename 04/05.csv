of non-diffeomorphic manifolds, all having the same trivial ${\bf R^4}$

a region which is topologically (but not smoothly) ${\bf B^3}\times {\bf R^1}$,
where ${\bf B^3}$ is the compact three ball. The exterior of this region is
diffeomorphic to standard ${\bf R^1}\times {\bf S^2}\times{\bf R^1}$. In a
space-time diagram, the confined exoticness sweeps out a world tube which, it
is conjectured, might act as a source for certain non-standard solutions to the
Einstein equations. It is shown that smooth Lorentz signature metrics can be
globally continued from ones given on appropriately defined regions, including
the exterior (standard) region. Similar constructs are provided for the
topology, ${\bf S^2}\times {\bf R^2}$ of the Kruskal form of the Schwarzschild
solution. This leads to conjectures on the existence of Einstein metrics which
are externally identical to standard black hole ones, but none of which can be
globally diffeomorphic to such standard objects. Certain aspects of the Cauchy
problem are also discussed in terms of ${\bf R^4_\Theta}$\models which are
``half-standard'', say for all $t<0,$ but for which $t$ cannot be globally

then use the above formalism to derive expressions which hold in the case when
the doorway state approximation is introduced. In applying the theory we limit
ourselves in this work to the case when the parity violating potential and the
strong interaction are one-body. In this approximation, using as the doorway
the giant spin-dipole resonance and employing well known optical potentials and
a time-reversal even, parity odd one-body interaction we calculate or estimate
the terms we derived. In our calculations we explicitly orthogonalize the
continuum and bound wave functions. We find the effects of orthogonalization to
be very important. Our conclusion is that the present one-body theory cannot
explain the average longitudinal asymmetry found in the recent polarized
neutron experiments. We also confirm the discrepancy, first pointed out by
Auerbach and Bowman, that emerges, between the calculated average asymmetry and
the parity violating spreading width, when distant doorways are used in the
