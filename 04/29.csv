simulations of oblique MHD cosmic ray (CR) modified plane shock evolution using
the two-fluid model for diffusive particle acceleration. The numerical shocks
evolve to published analytical steady state properties. In order to probe the
dynamical role of magnetic fields we have explored for these time asymptotic
states the parameter space of upstream fast mode Mach number, $M_f$, and plasma
$\beta$, compiling the results into maps of dynamical steady state CR
acceleration efficiency, $\epsilon_c$. These maps, along with additional
numerical experiments, show that $\epsilon_c$ is reduced through the action of
compressive work on tangential magnetic fields in CR-MHD shocks. Thus
$\epsilon_c$ in low $\beta$, moderate $M_f$ shocks tends to be smaller in quasi
perpendicular shocks than it would be high $\beta$ shocks of the same $M_f$.
This result supports earlier conclusions that strong, oblique magnetic fields
inhibit diffusive shock acceleration. For quasi parallel shocks with $\beta <
1$, on the other hand, $\epsilon_c$ seems to be increased at a given $M_f$ when
compared to high $\beta$ shocks. The apparent contradiction to the first
conclusion results, however, from the fact that for small $\beta$ quasi
parallel shocks, the fast mode Mach number is not a good measure of compression
through the shock. That is better reflected in the sonic Mach number, which is
greater. Acceleration efficiencies for high and low $\beta$ having comparable
sonic Mach numbers are more similar. Time evolution of CR-MHD shocks is
qualitatively similar to CR-gasdynamical shocks. However, several potentially
interesting differences are apparent.

discontinuities in some cases generates numerical oscillations. Tangential
discontinuities spread over more than 10 cells. Our tests confirm that slow

presented. Using the Fierz identity, we split the current-current four-Fermi
interaction in terms of a matrix valued auxiliary scalar field and compute its
effective potential. Energy consideration shows that contrary to earlier
expectations, parity in general is spontaneously broken at any finite order of
N, where N is the number of the two component spinors. In the large N limit,
there does not exist a stable vacuum of the theory thereby making the
application of the large N limit to Thirring model dangerous. A detailed
analysis for parity breaking solutions in N=2,3 cases is given.

models with spontaneously broken symmetry. The models possess topological
vortex excitations. It is argued that the smallest possible flux quanta are
composites of one quantum of each type $(1,1)$. These hybrid anyons will
dominate the statistical properties near the ground state. We analyse their
statistical interactions and find out that unlike in the case of Jackiw-Pi
solitons there is short range magnetic interaction which can lead to formation
of bound states of hybrid anyons. In addition to mutual interactions they
possess internal structure which can lead upon quantisation to discrete
spectrum of energy levels.

classified in Ref.\ \SU. The purpose of these notes is four-fold: \item{(i)}
Here we accomplish the SU(3) classification using only the most basic facts:
modular invariance; $M_{\la\mu}\in{\bf Z}_{\ge}$; and $M_{00}=1$. In \SU{} we
made use of less elementary results from Moore-Seiberg, in addition to these 3
basic facts. \item{(ii)} Ref.\ \SU{} was completed well over a year ago. Since
then I have found a number of significant simplifications to the general
argument. They are all included here. \item{(iii)} A number of people have
complained that some of the arguments in \SU{} were hard to follow. I have
tried here to be as explicit and as clear as possible. \item{(iv)} Hidden in
\SU{} were a number of smaller results which should be of independent value.
These are explicitly mentioned here.

Differences between canonical and kinematic quantities are pointed out. The

convenient to reformulate the general N--body theory starting from the fully
unclusterized (i.e., N <- N) amplitude. If we rewrite such an amplitude in
terms of new unknowns which can be later identified as the amplitudes for all
the (N-1) <- (N-1) cluster processes, and repeat recursively the procedure up
to the treatment of the 2 <- 2 cluster processes, we obtain very naturally the
hierarchy of equations which ranges from the N--body fully--disconnected
Lippmann--Schwinger equation to the N--body connected--kernel
Yakubovskii--Grassberger--Sandhas one. This revisitation turns out to be very
useful when considering the modifications required in case one of the bodies is
a pion and the remaining are nucleons, with the pion being allowed to disappear
and reappear through the action of a pion--nucleon vertex. In fact, we obtain a
new set of coupled pion-- multinucleon equations which allow a consistent and
simultaneous treatment of pion scattering and absorption. For the piNNN system,
the kernel of these coupled equations is shown to be connected after three
iterations.
