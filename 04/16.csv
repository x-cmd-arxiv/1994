detect any of the observed binaries, with typical 3-sigma upper limits of about
30 mJy. Combining our observations with previous 1300-micron observations of
PMS Taurus binaries by Beckwith et al. (1990) and others, we find that the
submillimeter fluxes from binaries with projected separations between 1 AU and
50 AU are significantly lower than fluxes from binaries with projected
separations > 50 AU. The submillimeter fluxes from the wider binaries are
consistent with those of PMS single stars. This may indicate lower disk surface
densities and masses in the close binaries. Alternatively, dynamical clearing
of gaps by close binaries is marginally sufficient to lower their submillimeter
fluxes to the observed levels, even without reduction of surface densities
elsewhere in the disks.

in total energy as a function of percent dimerization for a fixed $M$$M$

Thus the fit was incorrectly calculated, the LDA total energy surface is {\it

contradiction to their conclusion based on this erroneous fit, I show here that
the harmonic approximation (linear $M$$X$ springs to model the lattice energy)
is in fact very good, and a small quartic correction yields quantitative
agreement with the LDA total energy, though to this order more realistic

Owing to an amplification of the wave function at the core radius, the cross
sections for helicity flip processes can be largely enhanced. For $0 <\sin^2

for electrons is of the order $m_e^{-1}$ and is independent of angle. We
compare our results with those obtained in calculations of rates for baryon
number violating processes in the core of a cosmic string. In that case, while
the enhancement is a general phenomenon, its actual magnitude is extremely
sensitive to the fractional flux carried by the string core. Apart from showing
the existence of a similar enhancement effect for non-topological strings, our
results indicate that in some models the magnitude of enhancement can be
rendered much less sensitive to the value of the parameters in the theories.
Scattering of particles off semi-local strings and axion strings are also
considered.

pion coupling to the higher spin/isospin baryons $(I=J=3/2 , 5/2 , \cdots ,
N_c/2 )$ in a manner fixed by large-$N_c$ group theory. The solution involves
surprisingly elegant interplay between the classical and quantum properties of
a new configuration, the ``new improved skyrmion''. This is the near-hedgehog
obtained by minimizing the usual skyrmion mass functional augmented by an
all-important isorotational kinetic term. The numerics are pleasing: a $\Delta$
decay width within a few MeV of its measured value, and furthermore, the
higher-spin baryons $(I=J \ge 5/2 )$ with widths so large ($\Gamma > 800 MeV$)
that these undesirable large-$N_c$ artifacts effectively drop out of the
spectrum, and pose no phenomenological problem. Beyond these specific results,
we ground the Skyrme model in the Feynman Path Integral, and set up a
transparent collective coordinate formalism that makes maximal use of the
$1/N_c$ expansion. This approach elucidates the connection between skyrmions on
the one hand, and Feynman diagrams in an effective field theory on the other.
