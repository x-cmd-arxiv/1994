  misprints and is in smaller type. The paper has been accepted in the Memoirs
  of the AMS",,,,"funct-an math.OA",,"  We prove a classification theorem for purely infinte simple C*-algebras that
is strong enough to show that the tensor products of two different irrational
rotation algebras with the same even Cuntz algebra are isomorphic. In more
detail, let C be be the class of simple C*-algebras A which are direct limits A
= lim A_k, in which each A_k is a finite direct sum of algebras of the form
C(X) \otimes M_n \otimes O_m, where m is even, O_m is the Cuntz algebra, X is
either a point, a compact interval, or the circle S^1, and each map A_k ---> A
is approximately absorbing. (""Approximately absorbing"" is defined in Section 1
of the paper.) We show that two unital C*-algebras A and B in the class C are
isomorphic if and only if (K_0 (A), [1_A], K_1 (A)) is isomorphic to (K_0 (B),
[1_B], K_1 (B)). This class is large enough to exhaust all possible K-groups:
if G_0 and G_1 are countable odd torsion groups and g is in G_0, then there is
a C*-algebra A in C with (K_0 (A), [1_A], K_1 (A)) isomorphic to (G_0, g, G_1).
The class C contains the tensor products of irrational rotation algebras with
even Cuntz algebras. It is also closed under several natural operations.

simply connected compact K\""{a}hler surfaces with $p_g\geq 1$ are reexamined.
The $N=2$ symmetry is clarified in terms of a Dolbeault model of the
equivariant cohomology. We realize the non-algebraic part of Donaldson's
polynomial invariants as well as the algebraic part. We calculate Donaldson's
polynomials on $H^{2,0}(S,\BZ)\oplus H^{0,2}(S,\BZ)$.

"hep-th/9404010","Bong Lian","Bong H. Lian and Gregg J. Zuckerman","Some Classical and Quantum Algebras","19 pages",,,,"hep-th math.QA",,"  We discuss the notion of a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra and give several
classical examples from differential geometry and Lie theory. We introduce the
notion of a quantum operator algebra (QOA) as a generalization of a classical
operator algebra. In some examples, we view a QOA as a deformation of a
commutative algebra. We then review the notion of a vertex operator algebra
(VOA) and show that a vertex operator algebra is a QOA with some additional
structures. Finally, we establish a connection between BV algebras and VOAs.

characterized by a rational $W$ potential, which includes the minimal models of
A and D types as its subclasses. An explicit form of the $W$ potential is found
by solving the underlying dispersionless KP hierarchy in a particular small
phase space. We discuss also the dispersionless KP hierarchy in large phase
spaces by reformulating the hierarchy, and show that the $W$ potential takes a
universal form, which does not depend on a specific form of the solution in a
large space.
