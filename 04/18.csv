made with a 1.4 degree peak-to-peak sinusoidal chop in all bands. The FWHM beam
sizes were 0.55 +/- 0.05 degrees at 3.5 cm-1 and 0.75 +/-0.05 degrees at 6, 9,

observed at 3.5, 6 and 9 cm-1 with amplitudes similar to those observed in the

is consistent with CMB and inconsistent with thermal emission from interstellar
dust. The extrapolated amplitudes of synchrotron and free-free emission are too
small to account for the amplitude of the observed structure. If all of the
structure is attributed to CMB anisotropy with a Gaussian autocorrelation
function and a coherence angle of 25', then the most probable values of
DeltaT/TCMB in the 3.5, 6, and 9 cm-1 bands are 4.3 (+2.7, -1.6) x 10-5, 2.8

theory is expected to be valid. We find that the biased bispectrum continues to
follow the so-called hierarchical form, with reduced three-point amplitude Q

the quasi-linear perturbative regime the three-point amplitude depends on
configuration shape, a behavior that is found to give useful information about
the amount of bias without information about the unbiased matter distribution.

stellar-mass collapse or merger is, realistically, likely to generate a mass

10 seconds. If $\Gamma$ fluctuates by a factor of $\sim 2$ around its mean
value, relative motions within the outflowing material will themselves (in the
comoving frame) be relativistic, and can give rise to internal shocks. For
$\Gamma \sim 10^2$, the resultant dissipation occurs outside the 'photosphere'

investigated. Signature splitting as functions of $K$ and $j$ in the angular
momentum projection theory is explicitly shown and compared with those of the
particle rotor model. The observed deviations from these rules are due to the
band mixings. The recently measured $^{169}$Ta high spin data are taken as a
typical example where fruitful information about signature effects can be
extracted. Six bands, two of which have not yet been observed, were calculated
and discussed in detail in this paper. The experimentally unknown band head
energies are given.

Hartree-Fock variations and good enough to describe nuclear structure, we
construct mass formulae that rely on general scaling arguments and on a
schematic reading of shell model calculations. Fits to 1751 known binding
energies for N,Z$\geq 8$ lead to RMS errors of 614 keV with 14 parameters and
388 keV with 28 parameters. The latter is easily reduced to a 20 parameter form
at 423 keV.

correlations, as is supported by microscopic numerical calculations.
Introducing orthogonal channel correlations for the pp- and the ph-channel and
integrating the latter in terms of vibrational RPA-states we derive a retarded
two-body equation. Its solution is nonperturbative with respect to loops,
ladders and mixed contributions. In the stationary limit we obtain an equation
for a generalised effective interaction which iterates both the G-matrix and
the polarisation matrix. An in-medium scattering approach transparently
demonstrates the collisional damping of the vibrations.
