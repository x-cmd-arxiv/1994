  campana@astmim.mi.astro.it",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Paczy\'nski (1986) suggested that ``dark"" objects in the halo of our Galaxy
could enhance the luminosity of foreground stars, acting as gravitational
microlenses. Such events has been recently reported by different
collaborations. We assume that these microlensing events are produced by
baryonic objects in the halo of our Galaxy. Rather than adopting a mean mass
for the lensing objects we consider them distributed along a mass function
similar to the disk one. Even if the number of microlensing events so far
detected is not large, we show that it is possible to constrain the fraction of
mass density in the halo of our Galaxy in form of stars. We estimate that this
fraction varies between 0.1 and 0.8, if halo stars trace the total halo mass
density; in the opposite case this range becomes narrower. If lensing objects
have not been formed apart from the other halo stars, but in a more general
context of star formation, neutron stars must also be present. We discuss these
results in relation to galactic halo models for gamma-ray bursts.

numerical calculations of the current-voltage characteristics. We find that the
current-voltage characteristics in the damped regime are well described by a
model with a {\bf nonlinear} viscous force of the form $F_D=\eta(\dot y)\dot

found to apply also for triangular lattices in the overdamped regime. Further
qualitative understanding of the nature of the nonlinear friction on the vortex
motion is obtained from a graphic analysis of the microscopic vortex dynamics
in the array. The consequences of having this type of nonlinear friction law
are discussed and compared to previous theoretical and experimental studies.

  by J.D Brown, M.T. Chu, D.C. Ellison and R.J. Plemmons, SIAM, Philadelphia,
  1994",,,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  In this universe, governed fundamentally by quantum mechanical laws,
characterized by indeterminism and distributed probabilities, classical
deterministic laws are applicable over a wide range of time, place, and scale.
We review the origin of these laws in the context of the quantum mechanics of
closed systems, most generally, the universe as a whole. There probabilities
are predicted for members of decoherent sets of alternative histories of the
universe, ie ones for which the interference between pairs in the set is
negligible as measured by a decoherence functional. An expansion of the
decoherence functional in the separation between histories allows the form of
the deterministic equations of motion to be derived for suitable coarse
grainings of a class of non-relativistic systems, including ones with general
non-linear interactions. More coarse graining is needed to achieve classical
predictability than naive arguments based on the uncertainty principle would
suggest. Coarse graining is needed for decoherence, and coarse graining beyond
that for the inertia necessary to resist the noise that mechanisms of
decoherence produce. Sets of histories governed largely by deterministic laws
constitute the quasiclassical realm of everyday experience which is an emergent
feature of the closed system's initial condition and Hamiltonian. We analyse
the sensitivity of the existence of a quasiclassical realm to the particular
form of the initial condition. We find that almost any initial condition will
exhibit a quasiclassical realm of some sort, but only a small fraction of the
total number of possible initial states could reproduce the everyday
quasiclassical realm of our universe. (Talk given at the Lanczos Centenary

coefficients of the expansions are known to be dominated by the so called

contribution is associated with virtual momenta $k^2$ of order $Q^2e^n$ where
$Q$ is external momentum, $e$ is the base of natural logs and $n$ is the order
of perturbation theory considered. To evaluate the UV renormalon we develop
formalism of operator product expansion (OPE) which utilizes the observation
that $k^2\gg Q^2$. When applied to the simplest graphs the formalism reproduces
the known results in a compact form. In more generality, the formalism reveals
the fact that the class of the renormalon-type graphs is not well defined. In
particular, graphs with extra vacuum-polarization chains are not suppressed.
The reason is that while inclusion of extra chains lowers the power of $\ln
k^2$ their contribution is enhanced by combinatorial factors.
