pair potentials-of-mean-force in water are discussed. Dielectric model
calculations are implemented to check that these models produce that
characteristic structure of contact and solvent-separated minima for oppositely
charged ions in water under physiological thermodynamic conditions. Comparison
of the dielectric model results with the most current molecular level
information indicates that the dielectric model does not, however, provide an
accurate description of these potentials-of-mean-force. We note that linear
dielectric models correspond to modelistic implementations of second-order
thermodynamic perturbation theory for the excess chemical potential of a
distinguished solute molecule. Therefore, the molecular theory corresponding to
the dielectric models is second-order thermodynamic perturbation theory for
that excess chemical potential. The second-order, or fluctuation, term raises a
technical computational issue of treatment of long-ranged interactions similar
to the one which arises in calculation of the dielectric constant of the
solvent. It is contended that the most important step for further development
of dielectric models would be a separate assessment of the first-order
perturbative term (equivalently the {\it potential at zero charge} ) which
vanishes in the dielectric models but is generally nonzero. Parameterization of
radii and molecular volumes should then be based of the second-order
perturbative term alone. Illustrative initial calculations are presented and
discussed.

potentials of mean force in water along reaction paths for: a) formation of a
sodium chloride ion pair; b) the symmetric SN2 exchange of chloride in
methylchloride; and c) nucleophilic attack of formaldehyde by hydroxide anion.
For these cases simulation and XRISM results are available for comparison. The
accuracy of model predictions varies from spectacular to mediocre. It is argued
that: a) dielectric models are physical models, even though simplistic and
empirical; b) their successes suggest that second-order perturbation theory is
a physically sound description of free energies of electrostatic solvation; and
c) the most serious deficiency of the dielectric models lies in the definition
of cavity volumes. Second-order perturbation theory should therefore be used to
refine the dielectric models. These dielectric models make no attempt to assess
the role of packing effects but for solvation of classical electrostatic
interactions the dielectric models sometimes perform as well as the more
detailed XRISM theory.

signature unless it is re-expressed to allow for a finite source term on the
signature change surface. Consequently all conservation laws must also be
`modified', and therefore insistence on conservation of matter across such a
surface cannot be physically justified. The Darmois junction conditions
normally ensure conservation of matter via Israel's identities for the jump in
the energy-momentum density, but not when the signature changes. Modified
identities are derived for this jump when a signature change occurs, and the
resulting surface effects in the conservation laws are calculated. In general,
physical vector fields experience a jump in at least one component, and a
source term may therefore appear in the corresponding conservation law. Thus
current is also not conserved. These surface effects are a consequence of the
change in the character of physical law. The only way to recover standard
conservation laws is to impose restrictions that no realistic cosmological
model can satisfy.

gravitational waves. The technique of matched filtering used in the detection
of gravitational waves from coalescing binaries relies on the construction of
accurate templates. Until recently filters modelled on the quadrupole or the
Newtonian approximation were deemed sufficient. Recently it was shown that
post-Newtonian effects contribute to a secular growth in the phase difference
between the actual signal and its corresponding Newtonian template. In this
paper we investigate the possibility of compensating for the phase difference
caused by the post-Newtonian terms by allowing for a shift in the Newtonian
filter parameters. We find that Newtonian filters perform adequately for the
purpose of detecting the presence of the signal for both the initial and the
advanced LIGO detectors.

  View","26 pages, Bowling Green State Univ. preprint",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In order to clarify the connection between {\it current} and {\it
constituent} quarks (of u,d,s flavors), several authors have used the lightlike
chiral $SU(3)\otimes SU(3)$ algebra as a central concept. This literature is
reviewed here with the goal of offering an introduction to the subject within a
convenient, unified framework. It is shown that the null-plane Hamiltonian for
free massive fermions is chirally symmetric, provided only that the particles
have equal masses ($SU(3)$ limit). In the free quark model, hadrons can be
classified by a chiral $SU(3)\otimes SU(3)$ algebra, the generators of which
are current lightlike charges. Naturally, QCD interactions break chiral
symmetry, and the axial nonsinglet charges are not conserved. This remains true
in the 'chiral limit' (zero quark masses), signalling the spontaneous breakdown
of chiral symmetry. The actual generators of the $SU(3)\otimes SU(3)$
classification of physical hadrons are obtained from the current charges by
means of a unitary transformation. Under this transformation, quarks of the
same flavor and of opposite helicities mix to form a constituent quark. The
functional form of this unitary transformation can be strongly constrained on
the basis of symmetry arguments. This analysis is potentially rich in
phenomenological applications, and a few are presented here. The author offers
also some new theoretical results. No prior knowledge of light-cone formalism
on the part of the reader is assumed.

function of the Brezin-Gross-Witten Model (BGWM), which is defined as an
integral over unitary $N\times N$ matrices, $\int [dU] e^{\rm{Tr}(J^\dagger U +
JU^\dagger)}$, can also be considered as a GKM with potential ${\cal V}(X) =
\frac{1}{X}$. Moreover, it can be interpreted as the generating functional for
correlators in the Penner model. The strong and weak coupling phases of the
BGWM are identified with the ""character"" (weak coupling) and ""Kontsevich""
(strong coupling) phases of the GKM, respectively. This sort of GKM deserves
classification as $p=-2$ one (i.e. $c=28$ or $c=-2$) when in the Kontsevich
phase. This approach allows us to further identify the
Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) integral with a peculiar GKM, which arises
in the study of $c=1$ theory and, further, with a conventional 2-matrix model
which is rewritten in Miwa coordinates. Inspired by the considered unitary
matrix models, some further extensions of the GKM treatment which are inspired
by the unitary matrix models which we have considered are also developed. In
particular, as a by-product, a new simple method of fixing the Ward identities
for matrix models in an external field is presented.
