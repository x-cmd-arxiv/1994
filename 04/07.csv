cross-linked network is examined numerically. When the network is put in
contact with the tethered chain, the chain moves with dynamics that are highly
constrained due to entanglements. When the surface is repulsive, the chain runs
straight along the surface and then forms a plume in the network that starts at
a distance of order $\sim\!N^{1/2}$ from the graft point. For short times, the
chain length in the gel increases algebraically as a function of time, in most
cases as $\sim\!t^{1/2}$. The plume configuration is highly metastable and on a
much longer time scale the point of entry into the network decreases to zero.
This is similar to the relaxation of the arm of a star polymer in a
cross-linked network. The above findings are in agreement with the analytical
predictions of O'Connor and McLeish. The effects of a chemical disparity
between the grafted chain, the network, and the substrate are investigated.
Topological constraints are placed in the interface to determine their effects
on the dynamics. Chains tethered at both ends are also studied and show a
transition in behavior as a function of the thickness of the interface. Above a
critical thickness chain does not penetrate.

one-form $\omega^{a}_{\ b}$ as independent gravitational variables coupled to
2d massless Dirac matter is considered. It is shown that the classical
equations of motion are exactly integrated in the case of chiral fermions.

elements are strongly dependent on the deuteron helicity amplitudes, which are
expected to vanish for $1.4fm^{-1}<p<1.7fm^{-1}$.\vspace{10 mm}\\

calculated using relativistic kinetic theory. Free cross sections are used
which include contributions from $\rho$, $K^{*}$, $\Delta$ and heavier
resonances. Given pion to baryon ratios appropriate for the breakup stage of a
$200\cdot A$GeV relativistic-heavy-ion collision, we find for temperatures less
than 100 MeV, kaons have a shorter mean free path than pions, while for higher
breakup temperatures the reverse is true. Since breakup temperatures should be
in the neighborhood of 100 MeV, this suggests that kaon interferometry samples
the same emission distribution as pion interferometry.
