parametrized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z, the rotation
velocity and the velocity dispersion. This model is then fit to the $^{12}CO$

number of clouds. Simulations using discrete molecular clouds are carried out
to estimate the errors. The scale height of the molecular gas increases with
radius. The velocity dispersion varies from ~ 2 km/s to 11 km/s with a typical
uncertainty of ~3 km/s and shows a monotonic increase with galactic radius. The
midplane mass density of the disk calculated from the scale-height and velocity
dispersion is consistent with the local value \rho_0(R_0) of 0.2 \msun pc^{-3}.

Astrophysical Journal, in press",,"10.1086/174742",,"astro-ph",,"  We use N-body simulations to study the shape of mean cluster density and
velocity profiles formed via gravitational instability. The dependence of the
final structure on both cosmology and initial density field is examined, using
a grid of cosmologies and scale-free initial power spectra P\propto k^n. For
each model, we stack clusters to define an average density profile in the
non-linear regime. The profiles are well fit by a power law over 99% of the
cluster volume, with a clear trend toward steeper slopes with both increasing n
and decreasing Omega_o. For models with a Omega_o = 0.2, the profile slopes are
consistently higher than those for Omega-1.0. Cluster density profiles are thus
potentially useful cosmological diagnostics. We find no evidence for a constant
density core in any of the models, although the density profiles do tend to
flatten at small radii. Much of the flattening is due to the force softening
required by the simulations, and an attempt is made to recover the unsoftened
profiles assuming angular momentum invariance. The recovered profiles in the
Omega=1 cosmologies are consistent with a pure power law up to the highest
density contrasts (10^6) accessible with our resolution. The low density models
show significant deviations from a power law above density contrasts \sim 10^5.

affected by the cooling in the shocked gas behind the bow shock at the head of
the jet. We show that this cooling is very rapid, with the cooling distance of
the gas much less than the jet radius. Thus, although ambient gas is initially
driven away from the jet axis by the high thermal pressure odf the post-shock
gas, rapid cooling reduces the pressure and the outflow subsequently evolves in
a momentum-conserving snowplow fashion. The velocity of the ambient gas is high
in the vicinity of the jet head, but decreases rapidly as more material is
swept up. Thus, this type of outflow produces extremely high velocity clumps of
post shock gas which resemble the features seen in outflows. We have
investigated the transfer of momentum from the jet to the ambient medium as a
function of the jet parameters. We show that a low Mach number (<6) jet slows
down rapidly because it entrains ambient material along its sides. On the other
hand, the beam of a high Mach number jet is separated from the ambient gas by a
low density cocoon of post-shock gas, and this jet transfers momentum to the
ambient medium principally at the bow-shock. In high Mach number jets, as those
from young stellar objects, the dominant interaction is therefore at the bow
shock at the head of the jet.

anomalies are not invariant under supersymmetry (SUSY) transformations one
concludes that the theory is plagued also by a SUSY anomaly. For the gauge
groups $SO(32)$ and $E_8\times E_8$ we compute this SUSY anomaly, by solving a
coupled cohomology problem, and we show that it can be cancelled by subtracting
from the action the known Green--Schwarz counterterm, the same which cancels
also the ABBJ anomaly, the expected result. Finally, we argue that the
corresponding mechanism does not apply in the dual SUGRA-SYM, related to the
heterotic five-brane.

  An inner-outer factorization for any element in ${\Cal F}^2({\Cal H}_n)$ as
well as characterization of invertible elements in $F^\infty$ are obtained. We
also give a complete characterization of invariant subspaces for the left
creation operators $S_1,\cdots, S_n$ of ${\Cal F}^2({\Cal H}_n)$. This enables
us to show that every weakly (strongly) closed unital subalgebra of
$\{\varphi(S_1,\cdots,S_n):\varphi\in F^\infty\}$ is reflexive, extending in
this way the classical result of Sarason [S].
  Some properties of inner and outer functions and many examples are also
