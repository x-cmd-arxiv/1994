critical temperature of roughly a few meV (in the cosmological units h=c=k=1 ).
It is further pointed out that such a phase transition is natural in the
context of massive neutrinos. In fact,the neutrino masses required for quasar
production and those required to solve the solar neutrino problem by the MSW
mechanism are consistent with each other.

two vortices but with two markedly different sets of boundary conditions: on a
sphere and on a plane with quasi-periodic boundary conditions. We find that the
answers are very similar suggesting that the energy is localised to the
crossing point. The crossing energy is found to be field and temperature
dependent -- with a value at the experimentally measured melting line of
$U_\times \simeq 7.5 k T_m \simeq 1.16/c_L^2$, where $c_L$ is the Lindemann
melting criterion parameter. The crossing energy is then used with an extension
