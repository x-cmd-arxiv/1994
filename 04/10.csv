In the case of
magnetic field perturbations, we propose a scaling theory for the spin-glass
phase. Using the mean-field approach we argue that some pure states are
suppressed by the magnetic field and their free energy cost is determined by
the finite-temperature fixed point exponents. In this framework, numerical
results suggest that mean-field chaos exponents are probably exact in finite
dimensions. If we use the droplet approach, numerical results suggest that the
zero-temperature fixed point exponent $\theta$ is very close to
$\frac{d-3}{2}$. In both approaches $d=3$ is the lower critical dimension in
agreement with recent numerical simulations.

on a polarized hydrogen target, with measurement of the recoil proton
polarization, are considered. The observables are calculated in the one-neutron
exchange approximation, for the special case of backward scattering
($\theta_{c.m.} = 180^{\circ}$). Several new relations between polarization
observables of the reaction are derived within the framework of this
approximation.

Assume that for every n<omega the set of alphas with o(alpha)>= alpha^{+n} is
unbounded in kappa.Then there is a cardinal preserving extension satisfying
2^kappa=kappa^++ and GCH below kappa.
  By a result of W. Mitchell and the author the assumptions are optimal.
