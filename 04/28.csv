These generators are constructed using the de Rham representatives for the
cohomology of classifying spaces $BK$ where $K$ is a compact Lie group; such

Shulman. Thus our representatives for the generators of the cohomology of

work solves a problem posed by Weinstein, who gave a corresponding construction
(following Karshon and Goldman) of the symplectic forms on these moduli spaces.
We also give a corresponding construction of equivariant differential forms on
the extended moduli space $X$, which is a finite dimensional symplectic space
equipped with a Hamiltonian action of $K$ for which the symplectic reduced

less than the event rates predicted by the combined standard solar and

rates measured in the chlorine experiment (threshold 0.8 Mev) and the

  49",,"10.1093/mnras/270.4.781",,"astro-ph",,"  The Bloated Stars Scenario proposes that AGN broad line emission originates
in the winds or envelopes of bloated stars (BS). Its main advantage over BLR
cloud models is the gravitational confinement of the gas and its major
difficulty the large estimated number of BSs and resulting high mass loss rate.
We calculate the emission line spectrum by a detailed numerical photoionization
code for a wide range of wind structures and a detailed QSO nucleus model with
L(ion)=7E45 erg/s, M(bh)=8E7 Mo. The size and boundary density of the wind are
determined by various processes: Comptonization by the central ionizing source
(calculated self consistently), tidal disruption by the black hole and the
limit set by the wind's finite mass. We find that the emission spectrum is
mainly determined by the conditions at the boundary of the line emitting
fraction of the wind rather than by its internal structure. Comptonization
results in very high ionization parameters at the boundary which produces an
excess of unobserved broad high excitation forbidden lines. The finite mass
constraint limits the wind size, increases the boundary density and thus
improves the results. Slow decelerating mass-constrained flows with high gas
densities (1E8-1E12 cm^-3) are as success- ful as clouds in reproducing the
observed lines. Only 5E4 dense wind BSs are required in the inner 1/3 pc. This
small fraction approaches that of super- giants (SG) in the solar neighborhood
and the mass loss is consistent with the observational constraints. The BS
number is a very sensitive function of the wind structure. SG-like BSs are
ruled out by their high mass loss. BSs with dense winds can reproduce the BLR
line spectrum and be supported by the stellar population without excessive mass
loss and collisional destruction rates.

  version","Int.J.Theor.Phys.35:2057-2074,1996",,"IF-FI 95/3","hep-th",,"  We analyze the quantization of dynamical systems that do not involve any
background notion of space and time. We give a set of conditions for the
introduction of an intrinsic time in quantum mechanics. We show that these
conditions are a generalization of the usual procedure of deparametrization of
relational theories with hamiltonian constraint that allow to include systems
with an evolving Hilbert Space. We apply our quantization procedure to the
parametrized free particle and to some explicit examples of dynamical system
with an evolving Hilbert space. Finally, we conclude with some considerations
concerning the quantum gravity case.

gravities. Our approach follows directly the classic BRST formulation of
Yang-Mills theory in employing a derivative gauge condition instead of the
conventional conformal gauge condition, supplemented by an introduction of
momenta in order to put the ghost action back into first-order form. The
consequence of these simple changes is a considerable simplification of the
BRST formulation, the evaluation of anomalies and the expression of Wess-Zumino
consistency conditions. In particular, the transformation rules of all fields
now constitute a canonical transformation generated by the BRST operator $Q$,
and we obtain in this reformulation a new result that the anomaly in the BRST
Ward identity is obtained by application of the anomalous operator $Q^2$,
calculated using operator products, to the gauge fermion.

prove the following trinity: the general covariance, the conformal invariance

emphasize that the consistent and macroscopic universes like our own can only
exist for matter central charge $0<c<25$. We show that the spacetime
singularity at the big bang is resolved by the renormalization effect and
universes are found to bounce back from the big crunch. Our formulation may be
viewed as a Ginzburg-Landau theory which can describe both the broken and the
unbroken phase of quantum gravity and the phase transition between them.

surface which defines the boundary of space-time as seen by external static
observers, and we define a path integral in the presence of this dynamical
boundary. Using renormalization group arguments, we find that the dynamics of
the horizon is governed by the action of the relativistic bosonic membrane.
{}From the thermodynamical properties of this bosonic membrane we derive the
entropy and the temperature of black holes, and we find agreement with the
standard results. With this formalism we can also discuss the corrections to
the Hawking temperature when the mass $M$ of the black hole approaches the
Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$. When $M$ becomes as low as $(10-100) M_{\rm Pl}$ a
phase transition takes place and the specific heat of the black hole becomes
positive.
