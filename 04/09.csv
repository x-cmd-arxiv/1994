scales. The Lagrangian theory of gravitational instability of
Friedmann--Lema\^\i tre cosmogonies investigated and solved up to the third
order in the series of papers by Buchert (1989, 1992, 1993), Buchert \& Ehlers
(1993), Buchert (1994), Ehlers \& Buchert (1994), is compared with numerical
simulations. In this paper we study the dynamics of hierarchical models as a
second step. In the first step (Buchert, Melott and Wei{\ss} 1994) we analyzed
the performance of the Lagrangian schemes for pancake models, i.e., models
which initially have a truncated power spectrum. We here explore whether the
results found for pancake models carry over to hierarchical models which are
evolved deeply into the non--linear regime............We find that for spectra
with negative power--index the second--order scheme performs considerably
better than TZA in terms of statistics which probe the dynamics, and slightly
better in terms of low--order statistics like the power--spectrum. In cases
with much small--scale power the gain from the higher--order schemes is small,
but still measurable. However, in contrast to the results found for pancake
models, where the higher--order schemes get worse than TZA at late non--linear
stages and on small scales, we here find that the second--order model is as
robust as TZA, retaining the improvement at later stages and on smaller scales.

galaxies are investigated for different cosmological models and are compared
with observations. Four cosmological models are studied: standard ($\Omega=1$)
CDM, low-density CDM, HDM ($\Omega=1$), and PBI. We find that rich clusters of
galaxies exhibit a Maxwellian distribution of peculiar velocities in all
models, as expected from a Gaussian initial density fluctuation field. The
cluster 3-D velocity distribution is generally similar in the models: it peaks
at $v \sim 500$ km s$^{-1}$, and extends to high cluster velocities of $v \sim
1500$ km s$^{-1}$. Approximately 10\% of all model rich clusters move with high
peculiar velocities of $v \ge 10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. The highest velocity clusters
frequently originate in dense superclusters. The group velocity distribution
is, in general, similar to the velocity distribution of the rich clusters. In
all but the low-density CDM model, the mass exhibits a longer tail of high
velocities than do the clusters. This high-velocity tail originates mostly from
the high velocities that exist within rich clusters. The model velocity
distributions of groups and clusters of galaxies are compared with
observations. The data are generally consistent with the models, but exhibit a
somewhat larger high-velocity tail, to $v_r \sim 3000$ km s$^{-1}$. While this
high-velocity tail is similar to the HDM model predictions, the data are
consistent with the other models studied, including the low-density CDM model,
which best fits most other large-scale structure observations. The observed

energy gap of the high-temperature superconductors using the $t\!-\!J$ model

problem with similar physics, the spin susceptibility spectrum of the spin 1/2

oscillations of the system substantially decrease the spin gap to a value of
$(0.2 \pm 0.2)$ $\hbar \omega_c$, much less than the mean-field value of
$\hbar\omega_c$. The lower few Landau levels remain visible, though broadened
and shifted, in the spin susceptibility. As a check of the methods, the
single-particle Green's function of the non-interacting Bose gas viewed in the
fermionic representation, as computed by the same approximation scheme, agrees
well with the exact results. The same mechanism would reduce the gap of the

electron-phonon interaction from a Fermi-liquid point of view: the strong

on the $v_Fq/\omega$ ratio. These corrections generically lead to a strong
suppression of the effective coupling between quasiparticles mediated by a
single phonon exchange in the $v_Fq/\omega \gg 1$ limit. However, such effect
is not present when $v_Fq/\omega \ll 1$. Analyzing the Landau stability
criterion, we show that a sizable electron-phonon interaction can push the
system towards a phase-separation instability. A detailed analysis is then
carried out using a slave-boson approach for the infinite-U three-band Hubbard
model. In the presence of a coupling between the local hole density and a
dispersionless optical phonon, we explicitly confirm the strong dependence of
the hole-phonon coupling on the transferred momentum versus frequency ratio. We
also find that the exchange of phonons leads to an unstable phase with negative
compressibility already at small values of the bare hole-phonon coupling. Close
to the unstable region, we detect Cooper instabilities both in s- and d-wave
channels supporting a possible connection between phase separation and
superconductivity in strongly correlated systems.

Approximate Global $U(1)$ Family Symmetries (AGUFS) may provide one of the
simplest and attractive models in understanding origin and mechanisms of CP
violation at the weak scale. The whole new interactions of the model are
explicitly presented here. It is seen that CP violation can occur, after
spontaneous symmetry breaking, everywhere it can from a single CP-phase in the
vacuum. It is also shown that ""the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking
provides not only a mechanism for giving mass to the bosons and the fermions,
but also a mechanism for generating CP-phase of the bosons and the fermions"".
Four types of CP-violating mechanism are classified. A new type of CP-violating
mechanism is emphasized and can provide a consistent application to both the
established and the reported CP-violating phenomena. The smallness of the CKM
mixing angles and the induced KM-type CP-violating effects as well as the
suppression of flavor-changing neutral scalar interactions can be attributed to
the AGUFS and Partial Conservation of Neutral Flavor (PCNF). This suggests that
if one Higgs doublet is necessary for generation of mass, two Higgs doublets
are then needed for origin and phenomenology of CP violation. Various
interesting phenomenological features arising from this model are analyzed.
Their experimental implications and importance are discussed and emphasized.
Directly searching for the exotic Higgs bosons introduced in this model is
worthwhile at both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and hadron colliders.
