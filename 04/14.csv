minus signs cause difficulties. A Langevin equation method in conjunction with
a replication algorithm is used enabling one to average over a continuously
varying complex number. Instead of ensemble averaging this number directly, the
phase of the complex number is followed over time. The method is illustrated in
some simple cases where the answers obtained can be compared to exact results,
and also compared to conventional averaging procedures which converge orders of
magnitude slower than this method. Limitations of this method are also
described.
