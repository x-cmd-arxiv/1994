rotating interior superfluid leads to frictional heating that affects the
star's long-term thermal evolution and resulting surface emission. Here we
present the results of thermal evolution simulations based on two models of the
vortex pinning forces that bracket a range of plausible pinning strengths. We
include the effects of superfluidity, magnetic fields, and temperature
gradients. As representative standard and accelerated neutrino emission
processes taking place in the core, we consider the modified Urca process in
normal baryonic matter, and the much faster quark Urca process. Comparison of
our results with neutron star surface temperature data, including the recent
temperature measurement of the Geminga pulsar, shows that stars with soft
equations of state and modest frictional heating are in closest agreement with
the data; stars with stronger frictional heating have temperatures inconsistent
with the upper limit of PSR 1929+10. Stiffer stars undergoing standard cooling
generally have temperatures lying above the Vela detection, a situation
worsened by the inclusion of frictional heating. Stars undergoing accelerated
cooling without frictional heating have temperatures that fall far below most
temperature measurements; the Vela and Geminga detections being the most
compelling examples. Only in stiff stars, which have thick crusts, can the
inclusion of strong frictional heating raise the temperature at late stages in
the evolution to a level consistent with the data. However, such a large amount
of heating leads to a temperature at $\sim 1000$ yr in excess of the Crab upper
limit. Suppression of accelerated neutrino emission processes, perhaps by
superfluid pairing in the core, may yield acceptable cooling models.

the g-mode oscillations of the neutron star when the frequency of the tidal
driving force equals the intrinsic g-mode frequencies. We study the g-mode
oscillations of cold neutron stars using recent microscopic nuclear equations
of state, where we determine self-consistently the sound speed and
Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency in the nuclear liquid core. The properties of the
g-modes associated with the stable stratification of the core depend
sensitively on the pressure-density relation as well as the symmetry energy of
the dense nuclear matter. The frequencies of the first ten g-modes lie
approximately in the range of $10-100$ Hz. Resonant excitations of these
g-modes during the last few minutes of the binary coalescence result in energy
transfer and angular momentum transfer from the binary orbit to the neutron
star. The angular momentum transfer is possible because a dynamical tidal lag
develops even in the absence of fluid viscosity. However, since the coupling
between the g-mode and the tidal potential is rather weak, the amount of energy
transfer during a resonance and the induced orbital phase error are very small.
Resonant excitations of the g-modes play an important role in tidal heating of
binary neutron stars. Without the resonances, viscous dissipation is effective
only when the stars are close to contact. The resonant oscillations result in
dissipation at much larger orbital separation. The actual amount of tidal
heating depends on the viscosity of the neutron star. Using the microscopic
viscosity, we find that the binary neutron stars are heated to a temperature
$\sim 10^8$ K before they come into contact.

  REVTEX, Applied Physics Report 94-13",,,,"cond-mat",,"  The breakdown of conductance quantization in a quantum point contact in the
presence of random long-range impurity potential is discussed. It is shown that
in the linear response regime a decisive role is played by the indirect
backscattering mechanism via quasilocalized states at the Fermi level; this can
provide much higher backscattering rate than any direct backscattering process.
For the realistic contact lengths ($\leq 2000$nm) the scattering processes
prove to be independent, in spite of coherence of the electron wave. The
distribution function of conductance fluctuations is obtained by direct
numerical calculations as well as estimated within an analytical model for the
first time. It is shown to be a generalized Poisson distribution. Estimates are
made for quantum point contact performance at different choice of parameters.
In particular, it is the better the larger the intermode distance is compared
to the amplitude of the random impurity potential.

functions can be equipped with a Hilbert structure, such a Hilbert space must
coincide with that of the Lorentzian gravitational system under consideration.
The physical inner product can then be determined by imposing a set of
Lorentzian reality conditions. The Hilbert space of the gravitational model
admits in this case a basis of wormhole solutions, and every proper quantum
state can be interpreted as a superposition of wormholes. We also argue that
the wave functions that form the basis of wormholes must be eigenfunctions of a
complete set of compatible observables. The associated eigenvalues provide a
set of well-defined wormhole parameters, in the sense that they can be employed
to designate the different elements of the basis of wormholes. We analyse in
detail the case of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime minimally coupled to
a massless scalar field. For this minisuperspace, we prove the validity of all
the above statements and discuss various admissible choices of bases of
wormhole wave functions.

spinon is massive while the holon is massless. The situation is reversed with a

due to the massless degree of freedom, i.e. the holon for the attractive
