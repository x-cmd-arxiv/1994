galaxies seen in clusters as a function of redshift (the Butcher-Oemler effect)
can be explained very simply if structure formation in the universe proceeeds
hierarchically. We show that a rich cluster observed at high redshift has had a
significantly different evolutionary history to a cluster of the same richness
observed today. High redshift clusters take longer to assemble and thus under-
go more merging at small lookback times. We have investigated two models of
star formation in cluster galaxies: 1) a model in which star formation is
induced by galaxy-galaxy mergers and interactions and 2) a model in which star
formation is regulated by the infall of galaxies onto larger systems such as
groups and clusters. Both models produce trends consistent with the Butcher-
Oemler effect. Our models of cluster formation and evolution allow us to make
predictions about trends in the observed properties of clusters with redshift.
We find that there should be a correlation between the mass of the cluster or
group and the strength of the observed Butcher-Oemler effect, with more massive
systems exhibiting more evolution than less massive systems. We also predict
that both the blue galaxy fraction and the incidence of interacting galaxies in
rich clusters should rise continuously with redshift. Finally, we have explored
the influence of cosmological parameters on our predictions for cluster
evolution. We find that models in which structure formation occurs at very
early epochs, such as low $\Omega$ models, predict rather little recent star
formation and merging activity in clusters at redshifts of around 0.4.

from the statistics of the divergence field, $\theta \equiv H^{-1} \div v$, the
divergence of peculiar velocity, expressed in units of the Hubble constant, $H
\equiv 100 h km/s/Mpc$. The velocity field is spatially smoothed over $\sim 10
h^{-1} Mpc$ to remove strongly nonlinear effects. Assuming weakly-nonlinear
gravitational evolution from Gaussian initial fluctuations, and using
second-order perturbative analysis, we show that $ <\theta^3> \propto
-\Omega^{-0.6} <\theta^2>^2$. The constant of proportionality depends on the
smoothing window. For a top-hat of radius R and volume-weighted smoothing, this
constant is $26/7-\gamma$, where $\gamma=-d\log <\theta^2> / d\log R$. If the
power spectrum is a power law, $P(k)\propto k^n$, then $\gamma=3+n$. A Gaussian
window yields similar results. The resulting method for measuring $\Omega$ is
independent of any assumed biasing relation between galaxies and mass.
  The method has been successfully tested with numerical simulations. A
preliminary application to real data, provided by the POTENT recovery procedure
from observed velocities favors $\Omega \sim 1$. However, because of an
uncertain sampling error, this result should be treated as an assessment of the
feasibility of our method rather than a definitive measurement of $\Omega$.

scaling properties detected for the distribution of cosmic structures. Due to
the great variety of statistical methods to describe the large-scale structure
of the Universe, I will mainly concentrate on those methods which reveal
remarkable regularities and scaling in the structure of the Universe. Although
in most cases I prefer not to enter into the technical aspects of how
implementing such methods, more details will be furnishes about the description
of galaxy clustering in terms of fractal concepts. Despite recent claims for a
Universe, which behaves like a fractal at arbitrarily large scales, I will show
that the fractal language can be usefully employed to disprove this picture.
The emerging scenario is that of a Universe, which behaves like a self-similar
structure at small scales, where fractality is dynamically generated by
non-linear gravitational clustering, while preserving large-scale homogeneity.
Nevertheless, even at scales $\magcir 10\hm$, where gravity still acts
linearly, the distribution of galaxy clusters shows remarkable scale-invariant
features, which could give precise hints about the initial conditions for the
evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

there might be a large entropy of entanglement between the classical degrees of
freedom describing the black hole and the radiation fields when the theory of
quantum gravity plus matter is considered.

pure lattice QCD and chiral field. It always possesses a phase transition
between a strong coupling phase (where it reduces to a one-plaquette integral)
and a non-trivial weak coupling one. For the U(N) gauge group, it is equivalent
to some multi-matrix model. This analogy allows for determining possible large
N critical regimes thus generalizing the Gross-Witten phase transition in the
one-plaquetee model.

fundamental laws of physics must be invariant under exchange of any two
space-time events. The fact that this symmetry if obviously not observed is
attributed to the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism in
which the residual symmetry is diffeomorphism invariance on a continuum. The
approach has a discrete nature while dimensionality, continuity of space-time
and causality are abandoned as fundamental principles. Consequently space-time
is a dynamical object which may undergo changes of topology or dimension. A
number of different types of Event Symmetric model are described. The most
interesting models are event symmetric superstring models based on discrete
string supergroups.

the $3+1$-dimensional $U(1)$ higgs model by a collective coordinate method. In
the london limit, where the higgs mass becomes infinite, the gauge and
goldstone degrees of freedom are integrated out, resulting in the vortex
world-sheet action. Introducing an ultraviolet cut-off mimics the effect of
finite higgs mass. This action is non-polynomial in derivatives and depends on
the extrinsic curvature of the surface. Flat surfaces are stable if the
coherence length is less than the penetration depth. It is argued that in the
quantum abelian higgs model, vortex world-sheets are dominated by branched
polymers.

``type-rotating'' way on the vertices of a locally finite thick building of

of $\Gamma$ and unique normal form for each element of $\Gamma$, as described

transformations $\cal T$ of the set ${\Bbb P}_n$ of $n$th degree polynomials to

biorthogonal polynomials whose Borel measure is strictly sign consistent and
such that the ratio of consecutive generalized moments is a rational $[1/1]$
function of the parameter. Specific instances of strictly sign consistent
measures that have been debated in \cite{IN2} include $x^\mu\D\psi(x)$,
$\mu^x\D\psi(x)$ and $x^{\log_q\mu}\D\psi(x)$, $q\in(0,1)$. In this paper we
identify all measures $\psi$ such that their consecutive generalized moments
have a rational $[1/1]$ quotient, thereby characterizing all possible
zero-mapping transformations of this kind.

new explicit representation of the underlying orthogonal polynomials.
