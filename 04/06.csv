assumed to be reducible or nonnormal. The normalisation is a union of one or
more standard surfaces (scrolls and Veronese surfaces), marked with a conic as
double locus. The question is how to glue these together to get a Gorenstein
scheme. In characteristic 0, the results amount to a classification of
projective surfaces in the style of the 1880s. However, the methods involve a
study of the dualising sheaf of a nonnormal variety in terms of Rosenlicht
differentials, and there is a subtle pathology in characteristic p due to Mori

a line bundle on the surface, we show that the number of moduli of sheaves
which have a non-zero twisted (by the chosen line-bundle) endomorphism grows
slower than the expected dimension of the moduli space (for fixed rank and
increasing discriminant). The bounds we get are effective: we concentrate on
the case of rank two and we give a lower bound on the discriminant guaranteeing
that the moduli space is reduced of the expected dimension. We also give an
effective irreducibility result for complete intersections. All of the above
follows from a theorem bounding the dimension of complete subsets of the moduli

flattened dark halo. The misalignment between the disk and the halo is a common
explanation for galactic disk warps, since in this state, disks have precessing
bending modes which resemble real warps. A dubious assumption in this theory is
that the gravitational response of the halo is negligible. We therefore
calculate the response of an oblate halo to a precessing inclined exponential
disk using a variety of techniques. We construct models with a rigid
exponential disk precessing in a particle halo, a particle disk precessing
inside a static bulge/halo potential, and a self-consistent model with a
particle disk, bulge and halo. When the disk:halo mass ratio is small
($\sim$10\%) within 5 exponential scale radii, the disk settles to the
equatorial plane of the halo within 5 orbital times. When the disk and halo
mass are comparable, the halo rapidly aligns with the disk within a few orbital
times, while the disk inclination drops. The rapid response of the halo to a
inclined disk suggests that the warps seen in galactic disks are not likely the
bending modes of a precessing disk inside of triaxial halos. If a galaxy forms
inclined to the principal plane of a dark halo, either the disk will settle to
a principal plane or the inner halo will twist to align with the disk. The
outer halo will remain misaligned for a much longer time and therefore may
still exert a torque. Warped bending modes may still exist if the misalignment
of the outer halo persists for a Hubble time.

fully share the dynamical history of an average particle in the mass field. In
particular, galaxy tracers identified in numerical simulations can have

on the statistical weighting of collapsed regions, so that the tracer pairwise
dispersion is a different factor, \bvp, times the density field value. A model
of a cool equilibrium tracer population demonstrates that mass to light
segregation is very sensitive to single particle velocity bias. For the
$\phi=-GM/(r+a)$ potential a $\bvs=0.9$ tracer indicates a virial mass about a
factor of 5 low. The likely value of \bvs\ is estimated and the simple

$0.8\pm0.1$. The pairwise velocity dispersion bias, \bvp, which is equal to

the momentum conjugate to the clock time variable. The resolved constraint
leads to a functional Schr\""{o}dinger equation and formally to a conserved
inner product. The reference fluid that is described phenomenologically as
incoherent dust has the extraordinary property that the true Hamiltonian
density for the coupled system depends only on the gravitational variables. The
dust particles also endow space with a privileged system of coordinates that

by the coordinates of momentum and position spaces (which are both isomorphic
to the SO_q(3)-covariant real quantum space R_q^3). Their interrelations are
determined with the quantum group covariant differential calculus. For a
quantum mechanical representation of O on a Hilbert space essential self-
adjointness of specified observables and compatibility of the covariance of the
observable algebra with the action of the unitary continuous corepresent- ation
operator of the compact quantum matrix group SO_q(3) are required. It is shown
that each such quantum mechanical representation extends uniquely to a
self-adjoint representation of O. All these self-adjoint representations are
constructed. As an example an SO_q(3)-invariant Coulomb potential is intro-
duced, the corresponding Hamiltonian proved to be essentially self-adjoint and
its negative eigenvalues calculated with the help of a q-deformed Lenz-vector.

integrable, relativistically invariant field theories in correspondence with
the affine Kac-Moody algebras. The particles which are the quantum excitations
of the fields display interesting patterns in their masses and coupling and
which have recently been shown to extend to the classical soliton solutions
arising when the couplings are imaginary. Here these results are extended from
the untwisted to the twisted algebras. The new soliton solutions and their
masses are found by a folding procedure which can be applied to the affine
Kac-Moody algebras themselves to provide new insights into their structures.
The relevant foldings are related to inner automorphisms of the associated
finite dimensional Lie group which are calculated explicitly and related to
what is known as the twisted Coxeter element. The fact that the twisted affine
Kac-Moody algebras possess vertex operator constructions emerges naturally and
is relevant to the soliton solutions.

new contributions to the known results from $F$-term. Our mechanism is
naturally realized in many string models and in some cases, leads to remarkable
cancellations between $F$- and $D$-term contributions, providing the universal
scalar mass and vanishing cosmological constant. We illustrate how such a
possibility can arise by taking a simple orbifold example.

producing processes forces us to abandon the proposed scaling around $M_T$ =
2.6 GeV, which has been put forward as a possible signature of the presence of
quark-matter. Any substantial transverse expansion in the QGP phase itself will
also offset this scaling behaviour. The rates of lepton pair production are
time--integrated in Bjorken hydrodynamics and the different sources are
compared against each other.
