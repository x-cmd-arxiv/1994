structure of cosmic microwave background anisotropies to better than 5-10\% in
temperature fluctuations on {\it all} scales. It is applicable to {\it any}
model in which the potential fluctuations at recombination are both linear and
known. Moreover, it recovers and explains the presence of the ``Doppler peaks''
at degree scales as {\it driven} acoustic oscillations of the photon-baryon
fluid. We treat in detail such subtleties as the time dependence of the
gravitational driving force, anisotropic stress from the neutrino quadrupole,
and damping during the recombination process, again all from an analytic
standpoint. We apply this formalism to the standard cold dark matter model to
gain physical insight into the anisotropies, including the dependence of the
peak locations and heights on cosmological parameters such as $\Omega_b$ and
$h$, as well as model parameters such as the ionization history. Damping due to
the finite thickness of the last scattering surface and photon diffusion are
further more shown to be identical. In addition to being a powerful probe into
the nature of anisotropies, this treatment can be used in place of the standard
Boltzmann code where 5-10\% accuracy in temperature fluctuations is
satisfactory and/or speed is essential. Equally importantly, it can be used as
a portable standard by which numerical codes can be tested and compared.

Aurigae and present evidence that this star's radial velocity, spectroscopic
line widths and line depths are also variable with the same frequencies as the
photometric data ($f_1 \approx 0.795$ and $f_2 \approx 0.345$ d$^{-1}$). The
phases of these sinusoids are stable over time scales of longer than one year,
though the amplitudes can vary, making the prediction of photometric behavior
impossible. Given that a variety of other explanations have already been
discounted (e.g. interactions with a close companion, the existence of a lumpy,
orbiting ring of dust, or star spots) and that these variations occur on time
scales an order of magnitude slower than the fundamental radial pulsation
period, we have very strong evidence that 9 Aurigae exhibits non-radial {\it
g}-mode pulsations. Since the power spectrum of the radial velocity data shows
frequency $f_2$ but does not clearly show $f_1$, the present data suggest that
$f_2$ is associated with a low degree spherical harmonic ($\ell$ = 1 or 2),
while $f_1$ is associated with a higher degree harmonic. 9 Aurigae, along with
such stars as $\gamma$ Doradus, HD 224638, HD 224945, and HD 164615, appear to
constitute a new class of pulsating variables. These stars are to be found at
or beyond the cool edge of the Cepheid instability strip in the HR Diagram.
Prior to this, only much hotter stars have been shown to exhibit non-radial
{\it g}-modes.

gravitational evolution drives the distribution away from the Gaussian form,
generating measurable skewness and kurtosis even when the variance of the
fluctuations is much smaller than unity. We use perturbation theory to compute
the kurtosis of the mass density field and the velocity divergence field that
arises during the weakly non-linear evolution of initially Gaussian
fluctuations. We adopt an Einstein--de~Sitter universe for the perturbative
calculations, and we discuss the generalization to a universe of arbitrary
$\Omega$. We obtain semi-analytic results for the case of scale-free, power-law
spectra of the initial fluctuations and final smoothing of cosmic fields with a
Gaussian filter. We also give an exact analytical formula for the dependence of
the skewness of these fields on the power spectrum index. We show that the
kurtosis decreases with the power spectrum index, and we compare our more
accurate results for the kurtosis to previous estimates from Monte Carlo
integrations. We also compare our results to values obtained from cosmological
N-body simulations with power-law initial spectra. Measurements of the skewness

as the structures of many lexical forms are morphologically ambiguous. This
paper describes a POS tagger for Turkish text based on a full-scale two-level
specification of Turkish morphology that is based on a lexicon of about 24,000
root words. This is augmented with a multi-word and idiomatic construct
recognizer, and most importantly morphological disambiguator based on local
neighborhood constraints, heuristics and limited amount of statistical
information. The tagger also has functionality for statistics compilation and
fine tuning of the morphological analyzer, such as logging erroneous
morphological parses, commonly used roots, etc. Preliminary results indicate
that the tagger can tag about 98-99\% of the texts accurately with very minimal
user intervention. Furthermore for sentences morphologically disambiguated with
the tagger, an LFG parser developed for Turkish, generates, on the average,
50\% less ambiguous parses and parses almost 2.5 times faster. The tagging
functionality is not specific to Turkish, and can be applied to any language
with a proper morphological analysis interface.

is spontaneously broken by dynamical generation of a magnetic field. An

spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz invariance. Although symmetry generated by

Nambu-Goldstone boson, namely a photon. We argue that the Ward identities in
the Nambu-Goldstone theorem are saturated by the photon pole.

three chapters), expository in nature, attempts to place the current work in
context: at first historically, but then focusing on the Lax formalism and the
Adler--Gel'fand--Dickey scheme for hierarchies of the KdV type. The second part
(the last four chapters) comprises the main body of this work. It begins by
developing the supersymmetric Lax formalism, introducing the ring of formal
superpseudodifferential operators and the associated Poisson structures. We
discuss three supersymmetric extensions of the KP hierarchy (MRSKP, \SKP2, and
JSKP). We define and compute their additional symmetries and we find that the
algebra of additional symmetries are in all three cases isomorphic to the Lie
algebra of superdifferential operators. We discuss a new reduction of \SKP2 and
the relation between MRSKP and \SKP2 is clarified. Finally we consider the (so
far) only integrable hierarchy to have played a role in noncritical superstring
theory (sKdV-B). We identify it, prove its bihamiltonian integrability, and
extend it by odd flows. We close with a discussion of new integrable
supersymmetrizations of the KdV-like hierarchies suggested by the study of
sKdV-B. (This is the author's PhD Thesis from the Physics Deparment of the
