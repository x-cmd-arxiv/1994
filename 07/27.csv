  Journal, figures upon request, ask to bellazzini@astbo3.bo.astro.it",,"10.1086/175208",,"astro-ph",,"  Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) containing bright X sources (L_x > 10^{36}
erg/s), commonly associated with Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs), are found to
be significantly denser and more metal-rich than normal non-X-ray clusters both
in the Galaxy and in M31. Within a framework where LMXBs in GCs are generated
via tidal captures in high-density clusters and (2+1) encounters in low-density
globulars, the higher incidence of LMXBs with increasing metallicity is shown
to be {\it intrinsic} and not just a by-product of other effects. Two possible
mechanisms are examined: the first one assumes a dependence of the cluster IMF
on metallicity as recently published in the literature. The observed LMBXs,
more frequently occurring in metal rich clusters, agrees with the predicted
number of NS only if metallicity accounts for a minor contribution to the
observed variation of the IMF slope. Other alternatives explored, such as the
total variation of the observed IMF slopes is due to (a) just metallicity and
(b) the combination of metallicity and position in the Galaxy lead to a
clear-cut disagreement with the data. The second mechanism assumes that, at
fixed cluster density, the rate of tidal captures depends on radius and mass of
the capturing star. Based on standard stellar models, stars with higher metal
content have wider radii and higher masses, hence the rate of tidal captures
increases with increasing metallicity. From the order of magnitude computations
made, this new effect by itself could explain the observed ratio of 4 between
the frequencies of X-ray clusters in the metal-rich and metal-poor groups we
observationally determined. However, there is no reason to exclude that both
mechanisms can be at work.

the quantum fluctuations of Planck mass behave as mutations, such that new
inflationary domains may contain values of Planck mass that differ slightly
from their parent's. The selection mechanism establishes that the value of
Planck mass should be such as to increase the proper volume of the inflationary
domain, which will then generate more offsprings. For generic chaotic
potentials we find runaway probability distributions that move towards large
values of both inflaton and dilaton fields. Therefore, this mechanism predicts
that the effective Planck scale should be much larger than any given scale in
the problem.

approach to standard quantum theory specifically designed to apply to genuinely

an assumed separation of classical and quantum domains, on notions of
measurement, or on collapse of the wave function. Its primary aim is to find
sets of histories for closed systems exhibiting negligble interference, and
therefore, to which probabilities may be assigned. Such sets of histories are
called consistent or decoherent, and may be manipulated according to the rules
of ordinary (Boolean) logic. The approach provides a framework from which one
may predict the emergence of an approximately classical domain for macroscopic
systems, together with the conventional Copenhagen quantum mechanics for
microscropic subsystems. In the special case in which the total closed system
naturally separates into a distinguished subsystem coupled to an environment,
the decoherent histories approach is closed related to the quantum state
diffusion approach of Gisin and Percival.

$\pm q$) was recently studied in the leading WKB approximation. Here, we
consider generic quantum fluctuations in the corresponding instanton geometry
given by the Euclidean Ernst metric, in order to simulate the behaviour of the
one-loop tunneling rate. A detailed study of the Ernst metric suggests that for
sufficiently weak field $B$, the problem can be reduced to that of quantum
fluctuations around a single near-extremal Euclidean black hole in thermal
equilibrium with a heat bath of finite size. After appropriate renormalization
procedures, typical one-loop contributions to the WKB exponent are shown to be
inversely proportional to $B$, as $B\rightarrow 0$, indicating that the leading
Schwinger term is corrected by a small fraction $\sim \hbar /q^2$. We
demonstrate that this correction to the Schwinger term is actually due to a
semiclassical shift of the black hole mass-to-charge ratio that persists even
in the extremal limit. Finally we discuss a few loose ends.

that arise from the non-associativity and non-commutativity of this division

a notion of octonionic spinors and are used to give octonionic representations
of the respective orthogonal groups. Finally, the triality automorphisms are
shown to exhibit a manifest $\perm_3 \times SO(8)$ structure in this framework.

are proposed. First the complex(rational) powers are defined via an integral
representation,that allows to compute the conformal blocks, Green functions and
structure constants of OPA. Next an approach based on a system of recursion
equations for the Green functions is developed. A number of solutions of the
system is found. A lot of possible applications is briefly discussed.
