"astro-ph/9407063","Ethan Vishniac","E.T. Vishniac","The Dynamics of Flux Tubes in a High Beta Plasma","50 pages, aastex, astro-ph/yymmnnn",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We suggest a new model for the structure of a magnetic field embedded high
$\beta$ turbulent plasma, based on the popular notion that the magnetic field
will tend to separate into individual flux tubes. We point out that
interactions between the flux tubes will be dominated by coherent effects
stemming from the turbulent wakes created as the fluid streams by the flux
tubes. Balancing the attraction caused by shielding effects with turbulent
diffusion we find that flux tubes have typical radii comparable to the local
Mach number squared times the large scale eddy length, are arranged in a one
dimensional fractal pattern, have a radius of curvature comparable to the
largest scale eddies in the turbulence, and have an internal magnetic pressure
comparable to the ambient pressure. When the average magnetic energy density is
much less than the turbulent energy density the radius, internal magnetic field
and curvature scale of the flux tubes will be smaller than these estimates.
Realistic resistivity does not alter the macroscopic properties of the fluid or
the large scale magnetic field. In either case we show that the Sweet-Parker
reconnection rate is much faster than an eddy turnover time. Realistic stellar
plasmas are expected to either be in the ideal limit (e.g. the solar
photosphere) or the resistive limit (most of the solar convection zone). All
current numerical simulations of three dimensional MHD turbulence are in the
viscous regime and are inapplicable to stars or accretion disks.

the vicinity of the bubble walls of the phase transition, can be a sensitive
function of bubble wall velocity, and this velocity dependence is important to
include in the calculation of the baryon density of the universe. There is a
sensitive velocity dependence for all mechanisms of baryon production,
depending on the magnitude of velocity of the bubble wall, and we examine in

predicted by the charge transport mechanism of baryon production. For this

possible to detect these low-luminosity objects by their potential to act as
gravitational lenses, causing a characteristic brightening when they cross the
path of light from a star in a nearby galaxy. very recently, two groups
reported possible detections of microlensing of stars in the Large Magellanic

itself can account for the observed events. It is further shown that if stars
within the LMC are the lenses, the observed light curve can differ from the
light curve due to a galactic lens even at relatively low magnifications. This
provides a possibility of distinguishing between the galactic lenses and the
LMC lenses. For a given number of monitored stars, the LMC induced events
should be strongly concentrated towards the central region of the LMC, while
the galactic events should be uniformly spread over the whole area of the LMC,
so the two can also be distinguished statistically.

include dark matter, gas dynamics, radiative cooling, star formation, supernova
feedback and metal enrichment. The initial model is a rigidly rotating
overdense sphere with a mass of about 8 10^11 Msol which is perturbed by small
scale fluctuations according to a biased CDM power spectrum. Converging, Jeans
unstable and rapidly cooling regions are allowed to form stars. Via supernovae,
metal enriched gas is returned to the interstellar medium. {}From these initial
conditions a galaxy forms which shows the main properties of spiral galaxies: a
rotationally supported exponential disk which consists of young stars with
about solar metallicity, a slowly rotating halo of old metal poor stars, a
bulge of old metal rich stars and a slowly rotating extended halo of dark
matter. Bulge, stellar and dark halo are supported by an anisotropic velocity
dispersion and have a de Vaucouleurs surface density profile. The flattening of
the dark and stellar halo is too large to be explained by rotation only.
Whether the flattening of the bulge is caused by an anisotropic velocity
dispersion or by its rotation cannot be answered, because of the limited
numerical resolution due to gravitational softening. The velocity dispersion
and the thickness of the stellar disk increase with the age of the stars.
Considering only the young stellar component, the disk is cold (sigma=20

feature of gravity as a Higgs field issues from the fact that, in the presence
of different tetrad fields, there are nonequivalent representations of
cotangent vectors to $X^4$ by Dirac's matrices. It follows that fermion fields
must be regarded only in a pair with a certain tetrad field. These pairs

calculate the $D^{\pm,o,s}$ decay widths and the $B^{\pm,o,s}$ lifetime
differences. The results for D mesons are in agreement with the data,\, while
it is predicted that $[\Gamma (B^o)-\Gamma (B^-)]/\Gamma_B\se 4\%\,,$ and the
lifetime difference of the $B^o$ and $B_s$ mesons is even smaller. The role of
the weak annihilation and Pauli interference contributions to the lifetime
differences are described in detail. In the course of self-consistent
calculations the values of many parameters crucial for calculations with
charmed and beauty mesons are found. In particular,\, the perturbative pole
quark masses are: $M_c\se 1.65\,GeV,\,\, M_b\se 5.04\,GeV\,,$ and the decay
constants are: $f_D(M_c)\se 165\,MeV\,,\,\,f_B(M_b)\se 113\,MeV\,$. It is also
shown that the nonfactorizable corrections to the $B^o-{\bar B}^o$ mixing are
large,\, $B_B\se (1-18\%)\,.$ The values of the unitarity triangle parameters
are found which are consistent with these results and the data available
(except for the NA31 result for the $\epsilon ^{\prime}/\epsilon$ which is too
large): $\lambda\se 0.22\,,\,\, A\se 0.825\,,\,\,\rho \se -0.4\,,\,\, \eta \se
0.2\,.$

We connect the various terms in the K\""allen-Lehmann representation of the
quark propagator with appropriate combinations of hadron correlators, which may
ultimately be calculated in lattice $QCD$. Furthermore, using the positivity of
the path integral measure for vector like theories, we reanalyze some mass
inequalities in our formalism. A curiosity of the analysis is that, the exotic
components of the propagator (axial and tensor), produce terms in the hadron
correlators which, if not vanishing in the gauge field integration, lead to
violations of fundamental symmetries. The non observation of these violations
implies restrictions in the space-time structure of the contributing gauge
field configurations. In this way, lattice $QCD$ can help us analyze the
microscopic structure of the mechanisms for confinement.

on a half line is discussed. It is shown, by examining low-spin conserved
charges, that the boundary conditions preserving integrability are strongly
constrained. In particular, among the cases treated so far, $e_6^{(1)}$,
$d_n^{(1)}$ and $a_n^{(1)}, \ n\ge 2$, there can be no free parameters
introduced by such boundary conditions; indeed the only remaining freedom
(apart from choosing the simple condition $\partial_1\phi =0$), resides in a
choice of signs. For a special case of the boundary condition, accessible only
for $a_n^{(1)}$, it is pointed out that the classical boundary bound state
spectrum may be related to a set of reflection factors in the quantum field
theory. Some preliminary calculations are reported for other boundary
conditions, demonstrating that the classical scattering data satisfies the weak
coupling limit of the reflection bootstrap equation. (Invited talk at \lq
