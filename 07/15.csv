cosmic strings on the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR). We have
numerically evolved a network of cosmic strings from a redshift of $Z = 100$ to
the present and calculated the anisotropies which they induce. Based on a
limited number of realizations, we have compared the results of our simulations
with the observations of the COBE-DMR experiment. We have obtained a
preliminary estimate of the string mass-per-unit-length $\mu$ in the cosmic

in the plane of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and hence 500 pc in front of
the LMC center, this implies $\mu_\lmc<18.37\pm 0.04$. The determination rests
on a new measurement of the caustics in the ionized-emission light curves of
$t_-=75.0\pm 2.6\,$days and $t_+=390.0\pm 1.8\,$days. The estimate assumes that
the ring is circular. This assumption is shown to be consistent with the
available data and can be subjected to a future precise test. Moreover, I have
previously shown that modest deviations from circularity (eccentricities
$e<0.4$) affect the result by $<1\%$. The upper limit to the distance modulus
to M31 is $\mu_{\rm M31} < 24.43\pm 0.06$. If the response function of the

(1.4--1.6)$\pm$0.5, then a drop to 0.8, the higher values clearly seen to be
driven by $S/N$-power spectrum data points that do not fit single-tilt models.
These indices are nicely compatible with inflation values ($\sim$0.8--1.2), but
not overwhelmingly so.

not vanish. For this purpose the non--Hermitian Euclidean Dirac Hamiltonian is
generalized to the whole complex plane. The Laurent series are proven to reduce
to Taylor series for the corresponding eigenvalues and --functions as long as
field configurations are assumed for which level crossings do not occur. The
condition that no level crossings appears determines the radius convergence.
However, the need for regularization prohibits the derivation of an analytic
energy functional because real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are
treated differently. Consistency conditions for a Minkowski energy functional
are extracted from global gauge invariance and the current field identity for
the baryon current. Various treatments of the Nambu--Jona--Lasinio soliton are
examined with respect to these conditions. Motivated by the studies of the
Laurent series for the energy functional the Euclidean action is expanded in
terms of the $\omega$--field. It is argued that for this expansion the
proper--time regularization scheme has to be imposed on the operator level
rather than on an expression in terms of the one--particle eigenenergies. The
latter treatment is plagued by the inexact assumption that the Euclidean Dirac
Hamiltonian and its Hermitian conjugate can be diagonalized simultaneously. It
is then evident that approaches relying on counting powers of the
$\omega$--field in the one--particle eigenenergies are
