generating prosodically appropriate synthetic speech in response to database

intonation contour that is synthesized by rule under the control of a grammar,
a discourse model, and a knowledge base. The theory is based on Combinatory

the dynamics is dominated by superkink excitations that correspond to Mott

transport in samples that are sufficiently long in the direction of flux

phase naturally leads to pairing. Our building block is a simple molecular site
model inspired by C$_{60}$, but realized in closer similarity with Na$_3$. In

whose function is to switch on and off the Berry phase as the electron number
changes. The effective hamiltonians (electron-rotor and electron-pseudospin)
obtained in this way are then shown to exhibit a strong pairing phenomenon, by
means of 1D linear chain case studies. This emerges naturally from numerical
studies of small $N$-site rings, as well as from a BCS-like mean-field theory
formulation. The pairing may be explained as resulting from the exchange of
singlet pairs of orbital excitations, and is intimately connected with the
extra degeneracy implied by the Berry phase when the electron number is odd.
The relevance of this model to fullerides, to other molecular superconductors,

operators is described by an exchange relation with a braiding matrix, $Q$.
Using quantum consistency conditions, the braiding matrix is found explicitly
in the fundamental representation. This matrix is shown to be related to the
Racah matrix for $U_t(SL(N))$. From calculating the four-point functions with
the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, the deformation parameter $t$ is shown to
be $t=\exp({i\pi /(k+N)})$ when the level $k\ge 2$. For $k=1$, there are two
possible types of braiding, $t=\exp({i\pi /(1+N)})$ or $t=\exp(i\pi)$. In the
latter case, the chiral vertex operators are constructed explicitly by
extending the free field realisation a la Frenkel-Kac and Segal. This
construction gives an explicit description of how to chirally factorise the

integrable; this is confirmed by postulating a factorizable S-matrix to
describe their infra-red behaviour and then carrying out a stringent test of
this proposal. The test involves coupling the theory to a conserved charge and
evaluating the response of the free-energy both in perturbation theory to one
loop and directly from the S-matrix via the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with a
chemical potential at zero temperature. Comparison of these results provides
convincing evidence in favour of the proposed S-matrix; it also yields the
