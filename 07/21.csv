  Submitted to Nature","Science 267:980-983,1995","10.1126/science.267.5200.980",,"astro-ph",,"  Although cosmologists have been trying to determine the value of the Hubble
constant for nearly 65 years, they have only succeeded in limiting the range of
possibilities: most of the current observational determinations place the
Hubble constant between 50 km/s/Mpc and 90 km/s/Mpc. The uncertainty is
unfortunate because this fundamental parameter of cosmology determines both the
distance scale and the time scale, and thereby affects almost all aspects of
cosmology. Here we make the case for a Hubble constant that is even smaller
than the lower bound of the accepted range, arguing on the basis of the great
advantages, all theoretical in nature, of a Hubble constant of around 30
km/s/Mpc. Those advantages are: (1) a comfortable expansion age that avoids the
current age crisis; (2) a cold dark matter power spectrum whose shape is in
good agreement with the observational data and (3) which predicts an abundance
of clusters in close agreement with that of x-ray selected galaxy clusters; (4)
a nonbaryonic to baryonic mass ratio that is in better agreement with recent
determinations based upon cluster x-ray studies. In short, such a value for the
Hubble constant cures almost all the ills of the current theoretical orthodoxy,
a flat Universe comprised predominantly of cold dark matter.

by the Lorentz force while they are crossing the solar magnetic fields. Such a
deflection will result in the anisotropy of the solar neutrino flux. Because of
this anisotropy, the solar neutrino flux registered on earth can be reduced as
compared to the Standard Solar Model prediction. The mechanism is purely

quark tagging provides a sensitive and effective probe of the quark content of
the photon especially in the low $x$-region where the various models differ the
most. This process is complementary to others that have been studied in the
literature and can contribute to more precise determinations of quark and gluon
distributions inside the photon.

"hep-th/9407138",,"Martin Markl and Steve Shnider","Drinfel'd algebra deformations, homotopy comodules and the associahedra","44 pages",,,,"hep-th math.QA",,"  The aim of this work is to construct a cohomology theory controlling the
deformations of a general Drinfel'd algebra. The task is accomplished in three
steps. The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted
to a non-coassociative comultiplication. The following two steps each involve a
new, highly non-trivial, construction. The first construction, essentially
combinatorial, defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the
simplicial chain complex of the associahedra. The second construction, of a
more algebraic nature, is the definition of map of differential graded Lie
algebras from the complex defined above to the algebra of derivations on the
bar resolution. Using the existence of this map and the acyclicity of the
associahedra we can define a so-called homotopy comodule structure on the bar
resolution of a general Drinfeld algebra. This in turn allows us to define the
desired cohomology theory in terms of a complex which consists, roughly
speaking, of the bimodule and bicomodule maps from the bar resolution to the
modified cobar resolution. The complex is bigraded but not a bicomplex as in
the Gerstenhaber-Schack theory for bialgebra deformations. The new components
of the coboundary operator are defined via the constructions mentioned above.
As an application we show that the Drinfel'd deformation of the universal
enveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra is not a jump deformation. The
results of the paper were announced in the paper ""Drinfel'd algebra
deformations and the associahedra"" (IMRN, Duke Math. Journal, 4(1994), 169-176,

the discrete states by means of the $W$ constraints and the flow equations. Our
results coincide with the ones existing in the literature in those cases in

the extented two--matrix model is a realization of the discrete states of $c=1$

can be explained by the existence of two components of flow. In addition to
many similarities, difference in the deuteron flow is found between 12C + 12C

projective representation of the former $W_{\infty}$. Explicit expressions for
