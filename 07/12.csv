microlensing signature of massive compact objects in our galaxy would yield a
significant fraction of binary systems. Our calculations suggest that 40% of
the lightcurves that will be obtained in such searches may be sufficiently
perturbed to reveal, if sufficiently well-sampled, the presence of a compact
dark companion of Jovian mass orbiting a primary. The likelihood of occurrence
of perturbed lightcurves must also be taken into account by systematic search
programs, to improve their event detection efficiency. The statistics of
perturbed lensing events, if carefully interpreted, could yield estimates of
the incidence of binary systems with low mass ratios, including that of systems

  Hardcopies of figures and table available on request from dfrail@nrao.edu",,"10.1086/175038",,"astro-ph",,"  We have made VLA images of the fields around three young pulsars which have
resulted in the discovery of two new supernova remnants and confirmation of a
third. We argue that, in at least two cases and perhaps the third, the pulsars
are physically associated with these supernova remnants. A review of all known
young pulsars shows that the majority are associated with supernova remnants.
We show that the typical density of the interstellar medium into which the
supernova remnants are evolving has a density of 0.2 cm$^{-3}$ instead of the
low value of 0.01 cm$^{-3}$ which had been calculated from other studies, and
results in a considerably longer radio lifetime for supernova remnants. Both
the morphology of the supernova remnants and the location of the pulsars imply
that most of these young pulsars are born with large transverse velocities
($\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$). This high velocity mean in the distribution of pulsar
velocities appears to be a general property of the pulsar population at birth,
not seen in proper motion studies, due to selection effects. We explore the
implications of this result as it relates to the origin of these velocities and
the galactic distribution of pulsars. High velocity pulsars can escape their
supernova remnant in a very short timescale, comparable to the lifetime of the
remnant and may even play a role in extending the observable radio lifetime of
the remnant. A significant fraction will be capable of escaping the disk of the
Galaxy, producing an extended halo population.

at foreground clusters of galaxies can be used to determine the (projected)
mass distribution of the clusters. In the case of strong distortions, which
lead to arcs in clusters, the position of the arc and/or its radius of
curvature yields an estimate for the total mass inside a circle traced out by
the arc. Weak distortions, which can be observed to much larger angular
separations, can be used to determine the mass profile. In the case of weak
distortions, an approximation which identifies the observed distortion with the
shear produced by the lens can be made; this (linear) approximation breaks
down, however, if one wants to probe the center of the cluster, i.e., approach
the region within which giant arcs can be formed. The methods developed
hitherto, the most advanced of which is due to Kaiser \& Squires, rely on the
linear approximation and thus cannot yield reliable results for regions close
to the center of the cluster. The purpose of this paper is to provide a
theoretical basis to extend the Kaiser \& Squires method into the nonlinear
regime, thereby making it more powerful, since the nonlinear distortions
provide strong constraints on the mass profile, which in combination with the
weak distortions should yield more reliable cluster inversions. We discuss the
statistical properties of the observable image ellipticities and provide
several methods to determine the local distortion by the lens from observed

detailed comparison using the unscaled APM data for the five magnitude slices
with $\Delta b_j=0.5$ shows that, in fact, none of the models can actually fit
w(theta) for all the slices simultaneously.
  As $n=0.7$ tilted CDM and SCDM bracket all possible tilted models, we
conclude that none of the tilted models is consistent with the APM results.
With CHDM, a \wtheta amplitude that is 30\%--40\% too high on scales $\theta <
0.\deg 5$ is predicted for the deepest slices ($b_j\approx 20$). We find that
no reasonable simple variation of the parameters for the luminosity function or

other action, ${\bar S}$, the fluid four--velocity is proportional to the
totally antisymmetric product of gradients of the fluid Lagrangian coordinates.
The relationship between $S$ and ${\bar S}$ is established by expressing $S$ in
Hamiltonian form and identifying certain canonical coordinates as ignorable.
Elimination of these coordinates and their conjugates yields the action ${\bar
S}$. The key step in the analysis is a point canonical transformation in which
all tensor fields on space are expressed in terms of the Lagrangian coordinate
system supplied by the fluid. The canonical transformation is of interest in
its own right. It can be applied to any physical system that includes a
material medium described by Lagrangian coordinates. The result is a
Hamiltonian description of the system in which the momentum constraint is

gleaned from particle physics to suggest a fully covariant, conformal invariant
alternative. We explore the theory as a microscopic fundamental theory of
elementary particles, to thus give curvature a more prominent role in
elementary particle dynamics, and in particular in the generation both of
elementary particle masses and the extended bag-like models which are thought
to describe them. We discuss the degree to which conformal gravity can compete
with string theory as a consistent candidate microscopic theory of gravity.
Additionally, we explore the theory as a macroscopic theory of gravity where
the exact, non-perturbative, classical potential is found to be of the
confining $V(r)=-\beta /r+\gamma r/2$ form, a form which enables us to provide
an explanation for the general systematics of galactic rotational velocity
curves without the need to assume the existence of copious amounts of dark
matter; with this explanation of the curves apparently not being in conflict

spin-1 fields in the low energy QCD effective lagrangian. I assume that chiral
symmetry is nonlinearly realised and that spin-1 fields transform homogeneously
under chiral rotations, which is in sharp contrast to previous works where the
$\rho$ and the $a_1$ mesons were treated as approximate gauge bosons of some
chiral group. I emphasise the role played by four-meson couplings which in our
scheme are essential for the theory to make sense. By requiring the kinetic
energy density of the theory to be bounded from below we find inequalities
relating three- and four-point meson couplings. It is finally shown how the
combination of our analysis and of unitarity requirements naturally leads to a
low-energy phenomenological lagrangian for the nonanomalous sector of $\pi\rho
a_1$ strong interactions.

Field theoretic difficulties force us to introduce cutoffs that violate Lorentz
covariance and gauge invariance, and a new renormalization group formalism
based on a similarity transformation is used with coupling coherence to fix
cuonterterms that restore these symmetries. The counterterms contain functions
of longitudinal momentum fractions that severely complicate renormalization,
but they also offer possible resolutions of apparent contradictions between the
constituent picture and QCD. The similarity transformation and coupling
coherence are applied to QED; and it is shown that the resultant Hamiltonian
leads to standard lowest order bound state results, with the Coulomb
interaction emerging naturally. The same techniques are applied to QCD and with
physically motivated assumptions it is shown that a simple confinement
mechanism appears.

trivially (e.g., because the continuum hypothesis holds). For this purpose, we
use a Borel version of Vojtas's theory of generalized Galois-Tukey connections.
The second aspect is to analyze a sequential structure often found in proofs of
inequalities relating one characteristic to the minimum (or maximum) of two
others. Vojtas's max-min diagram, abstracted from such situations, can be
described in terms of a new, higher-type object in the category of generalized
Galois-Tukey connections. It turns out to occur also in other proofs of
inequalities where no minimum (or maximum) is mentioned.
