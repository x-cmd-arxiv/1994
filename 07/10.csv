Assume that the tangent bundle $T_X$ of $X$ is not stable (i.e. semi-stable or
unstable). Then $b_2\geq 2$ and a relative tangent sheaf $T_{X/Y}$ of a
contraction $f:X\longrightarrow Y$ of an extremal face on $X$ is a
destabilising subsheaf of $T_X$.

We
first present a partially new, fully local and gauge invariant system of
perturbation equations to treat microwave background and dark matter
fluctuations induced by topological defects (or any other type of seeds). We
show that this treatment is extremly well suited for linear numerical analysis
of structure formation by applying it to the texture scenario. Our numerical
results cover a larger dynamical range than previous investigations and are
complementary since we use substantially different methods.

chain with strong Coulomb repulsion, by using the numerical diagonalization
method. Using the Luttinger liquid theory, we obtained phase diagrams of the
ground state on $U_d-U_{pd}$ plane, where $U_d$ and $U_{pd}$ represent on-site
interaction at d-sites and the nearest-neighbor interaction between p- and
d-sites respectively. In the weak coupling region, they agree with the g-ology;
a superconducting phase (SC(I)) is restricted to attractive interaction
$U_{pd}<0$. On the other hand, in the strong coupling region, we found a novel
superconducting phase(SC(II)) for repulsive interaction $U_{pd}>|U_d|$ and a
insulating state with a charge gap for $U_d>U_d^c$ and $U_{pd}>U_{pd}^c$ with
critical values $U_d^c$ and $U_{pd}^c$ at half-filling.
  Away from half-filling, another superconducting phase (SC(III)) appears for
$U_d>>U_{pd}>0$; which has been found for $U_d\to \infty$ in the previous paper
[Physica {\bf C205} (1993) 170]. An analysis of the spin gap suggests that the
SC(I) and SC(II) include the Luther-Emery region (with spin-gap) in part, while
the SC(III) belongs to Tomonaga-Luttinger region (without spin-gap) in whole.
