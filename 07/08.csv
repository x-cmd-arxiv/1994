probably formed at an early epoch within large associations with similar
dynamical properties to globular or open clusters. We use the luminosity
function of globular clusters as a function of galactocentric distance to
provide a very strong constraint on the properties of RAMBOs. We show that at
the solar radius, dynamical constraints confine such clusters to a bounded and
narrow parameter space with effective radii between 1 pc and 15 pc,
corresponding to masses between $ \sim 10 -10^4 M_\odot$ and $\sim
10^4-10^6M_\odot$, respectively. Compact and massive clusters are excluded by
these constraints, and therefore cannot provide a heating source capable of
explaining the observed correlation between age and velocity dispersion for
disk stars. Less than 1\% of the halo could be within RAMBOs of mass
$10^7M_\odot$;an order magnitude lower than required in the model proposed by
Wasserman \& Salpeter. Neither the IRAS or ISO infrared satellites have the
capability to detect clusters of brown dwarfs within the dynamically allowed
parameter space. Clusters of white dwarfs that formed a Hubble time ago have a
surface brightness several magnitudes below the sky level; even clusters of low
mass stars at the edge of the main sequence would remain invisible to the
deepest K band surveys to date. We conclude that gravitational microlensing is
the only method capable of constraining the abundance of dark matter in the
form of clusters of stars. Recovering the dynamical properties of RAMBOs will
be very difficult due to their large covering factor and low internal velocity
dispersion.

nuclear collisions. Freezeout is due either to loss of thermal contact, or to
particles ``wandering'' out of the region of hot matter. We then develop a
thermal recombination model in which both single-particle (quark and antiquark)
and two-particle (quark-antiquark) densities are conserved. Conservation of
two-particle densities is necessary because quarks and antiquarks are always
produced in coincidence, so that the local two-particle density can be much
larger than the product of the single-particle densities. We use the freezeout
conditions and recombination model to discuss heavy resonance production at
zero baryon density in high energy nuclear collisions.

time dependence of the survival probability and of the spectrum of generalized
entropies evaluated in the space of 1p-1h and 2p-2h states. If the 2p-2h
background shows the characteristics typical for chaotic systems, the isovector
excitation evolves almost statistically while the isoscalar excitation remains
largely localized, even though it penetrates the whole available phase space.

the relativistic Vlasov-Uehling-Uhlenbeck model. The self-energies of the
antiproton are determined from the nucleon self-energies by the G-parity
transformation. Also, the final-state interactions of the antiproton including
both rescattering and annihilation are explicitly treated. With a soft nuclear
equation of state, the calculated antiproton momentum spectrum is in good
agreement with recent experimental data from the heavy-ion synchrotron at GSI.
The effect due to the reduced nucleon and antinucleon masses in a medium is
found to be more appreciable than in earlier Bevalac experiments with lighter
systems and at higher energies.

connected to the scalar field while its energy is shifted by the vector
potential, is extended to include the kaon degree of freedom. We further take
into account the medium modification of the kaon mass due to the explicit
chiral symmetry breaking. Both the propagation of kaons in the mean-field
potential and the kaon-baryon elastic scattering are explicitly treated in our
study. We find that the attractive kaon scalar mean-field potential in the
dense matter leads to an enhanced kaon yield in heavy-ion collisions at
energies of about 1 GeV/nucleon. The final-state kaon-baryon scattering is seen
to affect significantly the kaon momentum spectra, leading to an enhanced yield
of kaons with large momenta or at large laboratory angles. With a soft nuclear
equation of state and including the attractive kaon scalar potential, the
calculated kaon energy spectra agree with the data from the heavy-ion
synchrotron at GSI.
