  (current). Final version submitted",,,,"hep-ph",,"  One of the interesting features in unification models and supersymmetric
unification models is that the chiral states of quarks and leptons in a family
including a right-handed neutrino can be fitted neatly into a fundamental
spinor representation (f.s) of dimension 16 for the SO(10) gauge group.
However, it is shown in this paper that such a fundamental spinor
representation of SO(10) for Weyl fermions will generate global
(non-perturbative) gauge anomalies (of new type) when restricting to the
$SU(2)\otimes SU(2)\otimes SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ gauge subgroup. Such an example
is the four SU(2) factors obtained through the reduction of the subgroup
$SU(2)\otimes SO(7)$ of SO(10) with the SO(7) to the three SU(2) factors. The
branching rule in this case is given by $(f.s)\rightarrow (2-1-2-2)\oplus
(2-2-1-2)$ in terms of dimensions. A consistent gauge theory implies the gauge
symmetry in a gauge subgroup, and then needs to be well-defined when
restricting to the gauge subgroup. Consequently, a consistent SO(10) quantum
theory needs to satisfy our selection rule $N_f+N_{mf}=even\geq 4$, namely the
total number of generations with $N_f$ ordinary fermion families and $N_{mf}$
mirror fermion families is even and larger than three, and the three
generations of chiral fermions in this content can not correspond to a
consistent theory. Then we expect that there exist at least one additional
fermion family including a right-handed neutrino or at least one family of
mirror fermions including a left-handed mirror neutrino if SO(10) unification
theory is relevant to our realistic world. The next possibility is to have
total six generations that may subject to stringent

investigated in the framework of the pseudo SU(3) model, which has provided an
accurate description of collective nuclear structure and predicted half-lives
for the two neutrino mode in good agreement with experiments. In the case of
$^{238}U$ the calculated zero neutrino half-life is at least three orders of
magnitude greater than the two neutrino one, giving strong support of the
identification of the radiochemically determined half-life as being the two
neutrino double beta decay. For $^{150}Nd$ the zero neutrino matrix elements
are of the order of magnitude of, but lesser than, those evaluated using the
QRPA. This result confirms that different nuclear models produce similar zero
neutrino matrix elements, contrary to the two neutrino case. Using these pseudo
SU(3) results and the upper limit for the neutrino mass we estimate the
$\beta\beta_{0\nu}$ half-lives for six nuclei. An upper limit for majoron
