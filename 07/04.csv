stars in the Magellanic Clouds and Galactic Bulge, to search for very rare
gravitational microlensing events due to compact objects in the galactic halo
and disk. A preliminary analysis of one field in the Galactic Bulge, containing
{$\sim430,000$} stars observed for 190 days, reveals four stars which show
clear evidence for brightenings which are time-symmetric, achromatic in our two
passbands, and have shapes consistent with gravitational microlensing. This is
significantly higher than the $\sim 1$ event expected from microlensing by
known stars in the disk. If all four events are due to microlensing, a 95\%
confidence lower limit on the optical depth towards our bulge field is $1.3
\times 10^{-6}$, and a ``best fit"" value is $\tau \approx 1.6 \times
10^{-6}/\epsilon$,where $\epsilon$ is the detection efficiency of the
experiment, and $\epsilon < 0.4$. If the true optical depth is close to the
``best fit"" value, possible explanations include a ``maximal"" disk which
accounts for most of the galactic circular velocity at the solar radius, a halo
which is centrally concentrated, or bulge-bulge microlensing.

events of the galactic bulge stars, with the characteristic time scales in the

microlensing is larger than $ ( 3.3 \pm 1.2 ) \times 10^{-6}$, in excess of
current theoretical estimates, indicating a much higher efficiency for
microlensing by either bulge or disk lenses. We argue that the lenses are
likely to be ordinary stars in the galactic bar, which has its long axis
elongated towards us. A relation between $ t_0 $ and the lens masses remains
unknown until a quantitative model of bar microlensing becomes available. At
this time we have no evidence that the OGLE events are related to dark matter.
The geometry of lens distribution can be determined observationally when the
microlensing rate is measured over a larger range of galactic longitudes, like
$ -10^o < l < +10^o $, and the relative proper motions of the galactic bulge
(bar) stars are measured with the HST.

  International Conference on Nuclear Shapes and Nuclear Structure at Low
  Excitation Energies",,,"TUM-GA1 (June 1994)","nucl-th",,"  We have studied the anomalous behaviour of isotopic shifts of Pb nuclei in
the relativistic mean field theory. It has been shown that the relativistic
mean field provides an excellent description of the anomalous kink in the
isotopic shifts about $^{208}$Pb. This is in contrast from density-dependent
Skyrme forces which do not reproduce the observed trend in the empirical data
on the charge radii. We discuss some differences in the description of isotope
shifts in the RMF theory and the Skyrme mean field.
