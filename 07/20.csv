L(3.83) of the zero age horizontalbranch (ZAHB) at the RR Lyrae gap depends on
age and that the difference in visual magnitude between main sequence turn-off
(TO) and ZAHB may be calibrated in terms of age and metallicity. The results of
synthetic HB computations show that at fixed metallicity the mean luminosity of
RR Lyraes depends on HB morphology, as well as that the mean luminosity of
purely red horizontal branches depends on the age and amount of mass loss
during the red giant phase.
  Such features should be properly taken into account when the cluster age is
derived from the observed difference in magnitude between main sequence TO and
actual horizontal branch (rather than ZAHB). Moreover, it is shown that the
observed HB morphology provides us with an easy estimate of the upper limit of

inferred crossing times are much shorter than a Hubble time. These short
crossing times have led to considerable disagreement about the dynamical state
of these systems. We suggest that many of the observed groups are not
physically bound but are chance projections of galaxies well-separated along
the line of sight. Unlike earlier similar proposals, ours does not require that
the galaxies in the compact group be members of a more diffuse, but physically
bound entity. The probability of physically separated galaxies projecting into
an apparent compact group is non-negligible if most galaxies are distributed,
as observed, in thin filaments. We illustrate this general point with a
specific example: a simulation of a cold dark matter universe, in which
hydrodynamic effects are included to identify galaxies. The simulated galaxy
distribution is filamentary, and end-on views of these filaments produce
apparent galaxy associations that have sizes and velocity dispersions similar
to those of observed compact groups. The frequency of such projections can
explain the observed space-density of groups in the Hickson catalog. We discuss
the implications of our proposal for the formation and evolution of groups and
elliptical galaxies. The proposal can be tested by using redshift-independent
distance estimators to measure the line-of-sight spatial extent of nearby
compact groups.

give a free field realization of the type II $q$-vertex operator, which

taking a trace of the type I and the type II $q$-vertex operators over the

we obtain a residue formula for form factors, which is a lattice analog of the
higher spin extension of the Smirnov's formula in the massive integrable
quantum field theory. This result as well as the quantum deformation of the

the notion of quasi-determinant. We begin with a formal theory, corresponding
to the case of symmetric functions in an infinite number of independent
variables. This allows us to endow the resulting algebra with a Hopf structure,
which leads to a new method for computing in descent algebras. It also gives
unified reinterpretation of a number of classical constructions. Next, we study
the noncommutative analogs of symmetric polynomials. One arrives at different
constructions, according to the particular kind of application under
consideration. For example, when a polynomial with noncommutative coefficients
in one central variable is decomposed as a product of linear factors, the roots
of these factors differ from those of the expanded polynomial. Thus, according
to whether one is interested in the construction of a polynomial with given
roots or in the expansion of a product of linear factors, one has to consider
two distinct specializations of the formal symmetric functions. A third type
appears when one looks for a noncommutative generalization of applications
related to the notion of characteristic polynomial of a matrix. This
construction can be applied, for instance, to the noncommutative matrices
formed by the generators of the universal enveloping algebra $U(gl_n)$ or of

The fractional Matsubara frequency arises from the action of a pair of induced
merons at high temperature that are localized over a range on the order of the
meson Compton wavelength $1/m=\sqrt{\pi}/g$. We discuss the quenched
approximation in this model, and comment on the possible relevance of some of
