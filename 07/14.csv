destroy $^3He$ in the envelope gas that they return to the interstellar medium.
A simple argument based on the rates of limiting nuclear reactions shows that
the same giant branch mixing process which appears to be needed to explain the
observed $^{12}C/ ^{13}C$ and $C/N$ ratios in 1-- 2$\msol$ stars would indeed
also probably destroy $^3He$ by a large factor in the bulk of the envelope

transformations (hep-th/9401105 and hep-th/9403173), we give an explicit
path-integral representation for the bosonization of a massive fermion coupled
to a U(1) gauge potential (such as electromagnetism) in d space (D=d+1
spacetime) dimensions. The bosonic theory is described by a rank d-1
antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond-type gauge potential. We construct the bosonized
lagrangian explicitly in the limit of large fermion mass. We find that the
resulting action is local for d=2 (and given by a Chern-Simons action), but
nonlocal for d larger than 3. By coupling to a statistical Chern-Simons field
for d=2, we obtain a bosonized formulation of anyons. The bosonic theory may be
further dualized to a theory involving purely scalars, for any d, and we show
this to be governed by a higher-derivative lagrangian for which the scalar
decouples from the U(1) gauge potential.

present examples of localized endomorphisms $\varrho_1^{\rm loc}$ and
$\varrho_{1/2}^{\rm loc}$. It is shown that they lead to the same
superselection sectors as the global ones in the sense that unitary equivalence
$\pi_0\circ\varrho_1^{\rm loc}\cong\pi_1$ and $\pi_0\circ\varrho_{1/2}^{\rm
loc}\cong\pi_{1/2}$ holds. Araki's formalism of the selfdual CAR algebra is
used for the proof. We prove local normality and extend representations and
localized endomorphisms to a global algebra of observables which is generated
by local von Neumann algebras on the punctured circle. In this framework, we
manifestly prove fusion rules and derive statistics operators.

for SU(N) gauge theories which reduces the N-body quantum field problem to the
two-body level. The resulting set of nonlinear coupled equations fulfills all
conservation laws including fermion number, linear and angular momenta as well
as the total energy. Apart from the conservation laws in the space-time degrees
of freedom the Gauss law is conserved as a quantum expectation value
identically for all times. The same holds for the Ward identities as generated
by commutators of Gauss operators. The constraint dynamical equations are
highly non-perturbative and thus applicable also in the strong coupling regime,
as e.g. low-energy QCD problems.

by a modified vector derivative nonlinear Schroedinger equation, if charge
separation in Poisson's equation and the displacement current in Ampere's law
are properly taken into account. This modified equation cannot be reduced to
the standard derivative nonlinear Schroedinger equation and hence its possible
integrability and related properties need to be established afresh. Indeed, the
new equation is shown to be integrable by the existence of a bi--Hamiltonian
structure, which yields the recursion operator needed to generate an infinite
sequence of conserved densities. Some of these have been found explicitly by
symbolic computations based on the symmetry properties of the new equation.
Since the new equation includes as a special case the derivative nonlinear
Schroedinger equation, the recursion operator for the latter one is now readily
available.
