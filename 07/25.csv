Tokyo Astronomy Preprint No. 94-15",,"10.1086/117222",,"astro-ph",,"  We study the morphology of dark lanes and filaments in the dust-rich galaxy
NGC 253 using an unsharp-masked $B$-band optical photograph. Dust features are
classified as `arcs', which have heights and scale radius of about 100 to 300
pc, connecting two or more dark clouds, and `loops' and `bubbles', which are
developed forms of arcs, expanding into the disk-halo interface. These have
diameters of a few hundred pc to $\sim 1$ kpc. Among the bubbles, we notice a
peculiar round-shaped bubble above the nucleus, which could be a large-diameter
($\sim 300$ pc) supernova remnant exploded in the halo over the nucleus. We
also find `vertical dust streamers', which comprise bunches of narrow filaments
with a thickness of a few tens of pc and are almost perpendicular to the
galactic plane, extending coherently for 1 to 2 kpc toward the halo. Finally,
we note `short vertical dust filaments' (or spicules) are found in the central
region. We interpret these features as due to three-dimensional structures of
gas extending from the disk into the halo. We propose a `boiling disk' model
where the filamentary features are produced by star-forming activity in the
disk as well as the influence of magnetic fluxes. We discuss the implication of
the model for the chemical evolution of the ISM in a galaxy disk.

at a pair-separation of $r_0 = 14.3\pm1.75\hmpc$ (2$\sigma$ errors), consistent
with our earlier results from a smaller sample. The new observations provide an

the length of the scalar (``Higgs'') field and treats the gauge field as

second order phase transitions are discovered and the scaling laws for each are
studied by finite size scaling methods on lattices ranging from $6^4$ through
$24^4$. One line corresponds to monopole percolation and the other to a
transition between a ``Higgs'' and a ``Coulomb'' phase, labelled by divergent
specific heats. The lines of transitions cross in the interior of the phase
diagram and appear to be unrelated. The monopole percolation transition has
critical indices which are compatible with ordinary four dimensional
percolation uneffected by interactions. Finite size scaling and histogram
methods reveal that the specific heats on the ``Higgs-Coulomb'' transition line
are well-fit by the hypothesis that scalar quantum electrodynamics is
logarithmically trivial. The logarithms are measured in both finite size
scaling of the specific heat peaks as a function of volume as well as in the
coupling constant dependence of the specific heats measured on fixed but large
lattices. The theory is seen to be qualitatively similar to $\lambda\phi^{4}$.

models can be described by a two-dimensional interacting field theory of a
massless boson and two chiral fermions. We interpret this field theory as a
two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric theory of two chiral superfields, in which
one of the chiral superfields has a non-trivial vacuum expectation value.

  applications",,,,"OP-SF 25 Jul 1994","math.QA math.CA",,"  Generalised matrix elements of the irreducible representations of the quantum
$SU(2)$ group are defined using certain orthonormal bases of the representation
space. The generalised matrix elements are relatively infinitesimal invariant
with respect to Lie algebra like elements of the quantised universal enveloping
algebra of $sl(2)$. A full proof of the theorem announced by Noumi and Mimachi
[Proc. Japan Acad. Sci. {\bf 66}, Ser. A (1990), pp. 146--149] describing the
generalised matrix elements in terms of the full four-parameter family of
Askey-Wilson polynomials is given. Various known and new applications of this
interpretation are presented.

photoproduction amplitude. Here we demonstrate that unitarity and in particular
the inclusion of both the $\pi N$ and $\gamma\pi N$ thresholds on equal footing
yields a photoproduction amplitude that satisfies both two-body unitarity and
the generalized Ward-Takahashi identities. The final amplitude is a solution of
a set of coupled channel integral equations for the reactions $\pi
N\rightarrow\pi N$ and $\gamma N\rightarrow\pi N$. % Figures available from the
