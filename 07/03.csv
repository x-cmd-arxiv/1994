  contact spellegr@eso.org, ESO-1011","Astron.Astrophys.292:395,1994",,,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of the analysis of the ROSAT PSPC pointed observation
of the S0 galaxy NGC5866. Previous Einstein observations had revealed that this
galaxy has a low X-ray to optical ratio Lx/Lb. Theoretical models of the X-ra
emission of early-type galaxies had suggested that in objects of this kind the
emission is not dominated by the presence of a hot diffuse gas, but should
originate in stellar sources. We discuss the evidence in favor of this
hypothesis following from the results of the analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data.
The X-ray spectrum shows properties similar to those of the other two low Lx/Lb
early-type galaxies observed by ROSAT so far, including the presence of very
soft emission. So, these galaxies can be recognized as a group with homogeneous
properties, and a more exhaustive picture of the nature of the X-ray emission
across the Lx/Lb plane of early-type galaxies can be outlined. We also discuss
the importance of rotation in the X-ray emission of S0 galaxies, and suggest
that it could explain why on average S0s are less X-ray luminous than
ellipticals.

of the controversy between s-wave and d-wave character of High $T_c$
superconductivity. We show that anisotropic s-wave gap has the same low voltage
power law conductance and two peak structure in the density of states as d-wave
superconductors. The asymmetric tunneling conductance and zero bias conductance
for the c-axis tunneling is shown to occur because of finite band splitting
coming from the interlayer hopping parameter.

  within the MSSM","27 pages, 6 figures (available upon request). To appear in the
  Proceedings of the IFT Workshop on Yukawa Couplings and the Origins of mass,
  CERN-TH.7320/94",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We analyse the general features of the Higgs and supersymmetric particle
spectrum associated with the infrared fixed point solution of the top quark
mass in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We consider the constraints
on the mass parameters, which are derived from the condition of a proper
radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in the low and moderate $\tan\beta$
regime. In the case of universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the
high energy scale, the radiative $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ breaking, together
with the top quark Yukawa fixed point structure imply that, for any given value
of the top quark mass, the Higgs and supersymmetric particle spectrum is fully
determined as a function of only two supersymmetry breaking parameters. We show
that, for the interesting range of top quark mass values $M_t\simeq 175\pm 10$
GeV, both a light chargino and a light stop may be present in the spectrum. In
addition, for a given top quark mass, the infrared fixed point solution of the
top quark Yukawa coupling minimizes the value of the lightest CP-even Higgs
mass $m_h$. The resulting upper bounds on $m_h$ read $m_h \leq 90 \;(105)
\;(120)$ GeV for $M_t \leq 165 \;(175) \;(185)$ GeV.

  Proceedings of the IFT Workshop on Yukawa Yukawa Couplings and the Origins of
  Mass, CERN-TH.7321/94",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The minimal supersymmetric SO(10) model, in which not only the gauge but also
the third generation fermion Yukawa couplings are unified, provides a simple
and highly predictive theoretical scenario for the understanding of the origin
of the low energy gauge interactions and fermion masses. In the framework of
the MSSM, with universal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters at the grand
unification scale, large values of the universal gaugino mass $M_{1/2}\geq 300$
GeV are needed in order to induce a proper breakdown of the electroweak
symmetry. In addition, in order to obtain acceptable experimental values for
both the pole bottom mass and the $b\rightarrow s\gamma$ decay rate, even
larger values of the gaugino masses are required. The model is strongly
constrained by theoretical and phenomenological requirements and a heavy top
quark, with mass $M_t\geq 170$ GeV, is hard to accomodate within this scheme.
However, we show that to accommodate a top quark mass $M_t\simeq180$ GeV, it is
sufficient to relax the condition of universality of the scalar soft SUSY
breaking parameters at the grand unification scale. Still, the requirement of a
heavy top quark demands a very heavy squark spectrum, unless specific relations
between the soft SUSY breaking parameters are fulfilled.
