an m-polylogarithm represents the Beilinson Chern class on the rank m part of
the algebraic K-theory of the generic point of every complex algebraic variety.
One part of each such grassmann m-polylogarithm is a real, single-valued

prove that this function represents the Borel regulator (up to a factor of 2)
on K_{2m-1} of all number fields.

dimensions. For each allowed disorder configuration between two adjacent
columns, the contribution of the respective transfer matrix to the decay of
correlations is considered only as far as the ratio of its two largest
eigenvalues, allowing an economical calculation of a configuration-averaged
correlation length. Standard phenomenological-renormalisation procedures are
then used to analyse aspects of the phase boundary which are difficult to
assess accurately by alternative methods. For magnetic site concentration $p$
close to $p_c$, the extent of exponential behaviour of the $T_c \times p$ curve
is clearly seen for over two decades of variation of $p - p_c$. Close to the
pure-system limit, the exactly-known reduced slope is reproduced to a very good
approximation, though with non-monotonic convergence. The averaged correlation
lengths are inserted into the exponent-amplitude relationship predicted by
conformal invariance to hold at criticality. The resulting exponent $\eta$
remains near the pure value (1/4) for all intermediate concentrations until it
crosses over to the percolation value at the threshold.

are fitted to data at a fixed scale employing three model parameters. Using

A new method for calculating the back-reaction effects has been introduced, as
an expansion of the effective metric in powers of the matter energy-momentum
tensor. In the semiclassical limit the quantum corrections can be neglected,
and we show that physical states exists which contain the Hawking radiation.
The first order back-reaction effect is entirely due to the Hawking radiation.
It causes the black-hole mass to monotonically decrease, and it makes it
unbounded from bellow as the horizon is approched. The second order quantum
corrections have been estimated. Since the matter is propagating freely in this
unitary theory, we expect that the higher order corrections will stabilize the
mass, and the black hole will completely evaporate leaving a nearly flat space.
