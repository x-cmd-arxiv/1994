$S_J=\xibar_J/\xibar_2^{J-1}$, e.g., the skewness $S_3$ and kurtosis $S_4$, can
be predicted using non-linear perturbation theory. Comparison of these
predictions with moments of the observed galaxy distribution probes the bias
between galaxies and mass. Applying this method to models with initially
Gaussian fluctuations and power spectra $P(k)$ similar to that of galaxies in
the APM survey, we find that the predicted higher order moments $S_J(R)$ are in
good agreement with those directly inferred from the APM survey {\it in the
absence of bias}. We use this result to place limits on the linear and
non-linear bias parameters. Models in which the extra power observed on large
scales (with respect to standard CDM) is produced by scale-dependent bias match
the APM higher order amplitudes only if non-linear bias (rather than non-linear
gravity) generates the observed higher order moments. When normalized to COBE
DMR, these models are significantly ruled out by the $S_3$ observations. The
cold plus hot dark matter model normalized to COBE can reproduce the APM higher
order correlations if one introduces non-linear bias terms, while the
low-density CDM model with a cosmological constant does not require any bias to
fit the large-scale amplitudes.

the growth rate of perturbations as a function of the wavelength for various

due to the perturbations. Two types of unstable modes are found; one is due to
the self-gravity of the gaseous slab and the other is due to the velocity
shear. The former instability leads to the formation of star and star clusters.
Velocity shear decreases the growth rate of the former instability while it
increases that of the latter instability. Rotation also decreases the growth of
the former instability. As the slab grows in mass, the growth rate of the
self-gravitational instability increases and eventually becomes greater than
the growing timescale of the slab. Then a gravitationally bound condensation is
formed and its mass is larger when the slab has stronger velocity shear and
rotation.

constraint on the cold+hot dark matter (CDM+HDM) models. The hot component
reduces the excessive small-scale power in the COBE-normalized CDM model but
also delays the epoch of galaxy formation. We present results from the first
numerical simulations that have enough dynamic range to address accurately the
issue of high-redshift halo abundances in CDM+HDM models. Equivalent
high-resolution particle-particle/particle-mesh $N$-body simulations are
performed for spatially flat models with $\Omega_\nu =0.3$ and 0.2 (with
$H_0=50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_b=0.05$). We study the constraints
placed on the models by the high-redshift quasar space density and by the mass
fraction in neutral dense gas associated with damped Ly$\alpha$ systems. We
find that even with optimistic assumptions, the much-studied $\Omega_\nu=0.3$
model does not produce enough massive halos to account for the observed
abundance of quasars at $z>4$. The model passes this test if $\Omega_\nu$ is
decreased to 0.2. Both models do not produce enough high column-density halos
to account for the amount of gas in damped Ly$\alpha$ systems at $z\go 3$: the
$\Omega_\nu=0.3$ model falls short by a factor $\sim$80; the $\Omega_\nu=0.2$
model by a factor $\sim$3. We conclude that only CDM+HDM models with
$\Omega_\nu\lo 0.2$ can match observations at high redshift, implying an upper
bound of 4.7 eV on the most massive light neutrino (presumably the $\tau$).

gravity to simple models. First, we consider a Klein-Gordon particle in an ex-
ternal potential in Minkowski space and compare our proposal to the theory ob-
tained by deparametrizing with respect to a time slicing prior to quantiza-
tion. We show explicitly that the dynamics of the deparametrization approach
depends on the time slicing. Our proposal yields a dynamics independent of the
choice of time slicing at intermediate times but after the potential is turned
off, the dynamics does not return to the free particle dynamics. Next we apply
our proposal to the closed Robertson-Walker quantum cosmology with a massless
scalar field with the size of the universe as our time variable, so the only
dynamical variable is the scalar field. We show that the resulting theory has
the semi-classical behavior up to the classical turning point from expansion to
contraction, i.e., given a classical solution which expands for much longer
than the Planck time, there is a quantum state whose dynamical evolution
closely approximates this classical solution during the expansion. However,
when the ""time"" gets larger than the classical maximum, the scalar field be-
comes ""frozen"" at its value at the maximum expansion. We also obtain similar
results in the Taub model. In an Appendix we derive the form of the Wheeler-
DeWitt equation for the Bianchi models by performing a proper quantum reduc-
tion of the momentum constraints; this equation differs from the usual one ob-
tained by solving the momentum constraints classically, prior to quantization.

of a lower bound at time $t$ on a modified uncertainty function, essentially
the area enclosed by the $1-\sigma$ contour of the Wigner function. In both
cases the minimizing initial state is a non-minimal Gaussian pure state. These
generalized uncertainty relations supply a measure of the comparative size of
quantum and thermal fluctuations. We prove two simple inequalites, relating
uncertainty to von Neumann entropy, and the von Neumann entropy to linear
entropy. We also prove some results on the long-time limit of the Wigner
function for arbitrary initial states. For the harmonic oscillator the Wigner
function for all initial states becomes a Gaussian at large times (often, but
not always, a thermal state). We derive the explicit forms of the long-time

triangulations of the four-torus with general, non-regular incidence matrices.
We find that the simplicial lattice tends to develop spikes for vertices with
low coordination numbers even for vanishing gravitational coupling. Different
to the regular, hypercubic lattices almost exclusively used in previous
studies, we find now that the observables depend on the measure. Computations
with nonvanishing gravitational coupling still reveal the existence of a region
with well-defined expectation values. However, the phase structure depends on
the triangulation. Even with additional higher- order terms in the action the
critical behavior of the system changes with varying (local) coordination
numbers.

at the NLC with $\sqrt {s}$ in the 1-1.5 TeV range. We are thus lead to
consider the single $W_R$ production process $e^-e^-\rightarrow W_R^-(W_R^-)^*
\rightarrow W_R^-+jj$ in order to expand the collider's kinematic reach. After
pointing out that $W_R$'s with masses of order 1 TeV may be missed by future
hadron collider searches, we demonstrate that this three-body process possesses
a significant cross section, of order several fb, at the NLC with $\sqrt {s}$
in the range above. The angular distribution of the produced $W_R$'s is shown
to be essentially flat and the potential backgrounds from standard model
processes are shown to be small.
