the high rotation speeds of gas and stars in the outer parts of spiral
galaxies$^{1}$. The volume density of this dark matter decreases less quickly
from the galactic center than does that of the luminous mass (such as that in
stars), meaning that the dark matter dominates the mass far from the
center$^{1,2}$. While searching for faint starlight away from the plane of the
edge-on disk galaxy \gal$^{3}$, we have found that the galaxy is surrounded by
a faint luminous halo. The intensity of light from this halo falls less steeply
than any known luminous component of spiral galaxies, but is consistent with
the distribution of dark mass inferred from the galaxy's rotation curve.

cohomology of the target space and this allows for the homological analysis of
the obstruction. As a check, we recover the obstructions of Hull and Spence and
also a generalization of the topological terms found by Hull, Rocek and de Wit.
When the symmetry group is compact, we use topological tools to derive
vanishing theorems which guarantee the absence of obstructions for low
dimension (d<=4) but for a variety of target manifolds. For example, any
compact semisimple Lie group can be gauged in a three-dimensional sigma-model
with simply connected target space. When the symmetry group is semisimple but
not necessarily compact, we argue in favor of the persistence of these
vanishing theorems by making use of (conjectural) equivariant minimal models
(in the sense of Sullivan). By way of persuasion, we construct by hand a few
such equivariant minimal models, which may be of independent interest. We
illustrate our results with two examples: d=1 with a symplectic target space,
and d=2 with target space a Lie group admitting a bi-invariant metric. An
alternative homological interpretation of the obstruction is obtained by a
closer study of the Noether method. This method displays the obstruction as a
class in BRST cohomology at ghost number 1. We comment on the relationship with
consistent anomalies.
