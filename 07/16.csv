clustering. These effects occur when distances to the galaxies are estimated
from their redshifts. It is assumed that the clustering pattern results from
the gravitational instability of initially Gaussian, small-amplitude
perturbations of a Friedman-Lemaitre cosmological model. Explicit expressions
are given for an arbitrary density parameter \Omega of the model, both when the
cosmological constant, \Lambda, is zero, and when the model is spatially flat,
\Omega + \Lambda/3H^2 =1. We show how to compute the skewness, or third moment
of the density field, in redshift space, and its Fourier space counterpart, the
bispectrum. We rely on a perturbative expansion of particle trajectories in
Lagrangian coordinates. This formalism extends to higher orders the Zel'dovich
first order solution (1970). We show that a physically consistent and
quantitatively accurate analysis of the growth skewness in redshift space can
be obtained from second-order Lagrangian theory. We also study the effects of
spatial smoothing of the evolved density field. We give analytic expressions
for the gravitationally induced skewness as a function of the power spectrum
and of \Omega, for a spherical top-hat and a Gaussian smoothing filter. We
compare our analytical predictions with measurements performed in numerical
simulations, and find good agreement. These results should then prove useful in
analyzing large scale redshift surveys. In particular, our results, in

formulation in an appropriate physical subspace. We construct a Fock space of
charged particle states that satisfy Gauss's law, and show that they obey
fermion, not fractional statistics. The gauge-invariant spinor field that
creates these charged states from the vacuum obeys the anticommutation rules
that generally apply to spinor fields. The Hamiltonian, when described in the
representation in which the charged fermions are the propagating particle
excitations that obey Gauss's law, contains an interaction between charge and
transverse current densities. We observe that the implementation of Gauss's law
and the gauge condition does not require us to use fields with graded
commutator algebras or particle excitations with fractional statistics. In our
Coulomb gauge formulation, we implement Gauss's law and the gauge condition,
$\partial_lA_l=0$, by the Dirac-Bergmann procedure. In this formulation, the
constrained gauge fields become functionals of the spinor fields, and are not
independent degrees of freedom. The formulation in the Coulomb gauge confirms
the results we obtained in the temporal gauge: The ``Dirac-Bergmann''

dimensions and the theory of 2-knots (embedded 2-spheres in a 4-manifold). The
so-called BF theories allow the construction of quantum operators whose trace
can be considered as the higher-dimensional generalization of Wilson lines for
knots in 3-dimensions. First-order perturbative calculations lead to higher
dimensional linking numbers, and it is possible to establish a heuristic
relation between BF theories and Alexander invariants. Functional
integration-by-parts techniques allow the recovery of an infinitesimal version
of the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation, in the form considered by Carter and
Saito.

introduced. In addition to the two-dimensional ``phase space'' variables
$(k,x)$ of the dispersionless KP hierarchy, this hierarchy has extra spatial
dimensions compactified to a two (or any even) dimensional torus. Integrability
of this hierarchy and the existence of an infinite dimensional of ``additional
symmetries'' are ensured by an underlying twistor theoretical structure (or a
nonlinear Riemann-Hilbert problem). An analogue of the tau function, whose
logarithm gives the $F$ function (``free energy'' or ``prepotential'' in the
contest of matrix models and topological conformal field theories), is
constructed. The infinite dimensional symmetries can be extended to this tau
(or $F$) function. The extended symmetries, just like those of the
dispersionless KP hierarchy, obey an anomalous commutation relations.
