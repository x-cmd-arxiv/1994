objects such as quasars. Because of well defined selection criteria quasars
found by a ultraviolet excess (UVX) survey are ideal candidates for testing the
model out to a redshift of z = 2.2. The static cosmology proposed by Crawford
(1993) is used to analyse a recent quasar survey (BOYLE et al MNRAS 227, 717
1990). It is shown that the distribution of number of quasars from the survey
as a function of redshift is in excellent agreement with the predictions of the
model. A V/V_m test on 351 confirmed quasars with defined redshifts has a mean
value of 0.568\pm 0.015 with the discrepancy being most likely due to
incompleteness of the catalogue at low redshifts. For the redshift range $1.5 <
z < 2.2$ where the accuracy of the cosmological model is critical V/V_m was
0.51 \pm 0.02. A well defined quasar luminosity function is derived that has a
peak at M_B = -21.16 mag and is well fitted by a Gaussian distribution in
absolute magnitude with a standard deviation of 1.52 magnitudes.

the angular size of known objects as a function of distance. Thus the
distribution of angular sizes provides a critical test of the stable and static
model of the universe described by Crawford (1991,1993) that has a simple and
explicit relationship between the angular size of an object and its redshift.
The result is that the agreement with observations of galactic diameters and
the size of double radio sources with the static model is much better than the
standard (Big Bang) theory without evolution. However there is still a small
discrepancy at large redshifts that could be due to selection effects.

  steps in Josephson junction arrays","33 pages, TEX-Macro included",,"10.1142/S0217979294001639",,"cond-mat chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  This is a review of recent work on the dynamic response of Josephson junction
arrays driven by dc and ac currents. The arrays are modeled by the resistively
shunted Josephson junction model, appropriate for proximity effect junctions,
including self-induced magnetic fields as well as disorder. The relevance of
the self-induced fields is measured as a function of a parameter
$\kappa=\lambda_L/a$, with $\lambda_L$ the London penetration depth of the
arrays, and $a$ the lattice spacing. The transition from Type II ($\kappa>1$)
to Type I ($\kappa <1$) behavior is studied in detail. We compare the results
for models with self, self+nearest-neighbor, and full inductance matrices. In
the $\kappa=\infty$ limit, we find that when the initial state has at least one
vortex-antivortex pair, after a characteristic transient time these vortices
unbind and {\it radiate} other vortices. These radiated vortices settle into a
parity-broken, time-periodic, {\em axisymmetric coherent vortex state} (ACVS),
characterized by alternate rows of positive and negative vortices lying along a
tilted axis. The ACVS produces subharmonic steps in the current voltage (IV)
characteristics, typical of giant Shapiro steps. For finite $\kappa$ we find
that the IV's show subharmonic giant Shapiro steps, even at zero external
magnetic field. We find that these subharmonic steps are produced by a whole
family of coherent vortex oscillating patterns, with their structure changing
as a function of $\kappa$. In general, we find that these patterns are due to a
break down of translational invariance produced, for example, by disorder or
antisymmetric edge-fields. The zero field case results are in good qualitative
agreement with experiments

  INFN-FE-05-94",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We present a new predictive approach based on SUSY $SO(10)$ theory. The
inter-family hierarchy is first generated in the sector of hypothetical
superheavy fermions and then transfered inversely to ordinary quarks and
leptons by means of the universal seesaw mechanism. The obtained mass matrices
are simply parametrized by two small complex coefficients $\eps_u$ and
$\eps_d$, which can be given by the ratio of the GUT scale $M_G\simeq 10^{16}$
GeV and some higher scale $M\simeq 10^{17}-10^{18}$ GeV (presumably superstring
scale). The model provides a possibility for doublet-triplet splitting without
fine tuning and the Higgsino mediated $d=5$ operators for the proton decay are
naturally suppressed.
  Our ansatz provides the correct {\em qualitative} picture of fermion mass
hierarchy and mixing pattern, provided that $\eps_d/\eps_u\sim 10$. The running
masses of the first family fermions: electron, u-quark and d-quark obey an
approximate $SO(10)$ symmetry limit. At GUT scale we have: $u\sim d\simeq 3e$,
$(\frac{\eps_u}{\eps_d})c\sim s\simeq \frac{1}{3}\mu$ and
$(\frac{\eps_u}{\eps_d})^2t\sim b\simeq \tau$. The Cabibbo angle is large:
$s_{12}\simeq \sqrt{m_d/m_s}$ while other mixing angles have their natural
size: $s_{23}\sim m_s/m_b$ and $s_{13}\sim m_d/m_b$. We have many strong {\em
quantitative} predictions though no special `zero' texture is utilized (in
contrast to the known predictive frameworks). Namely, taking as input the
lepton, c-quark and b-quark masses, $m_s/m_d$ mass ratio and Cabibbo angle, we
can obtain the light (u,d,s) quark masses, top mass and $\tan\beta$. The top
quark is naturally in the 100 GeV range, but not too heavy: $m_t<165$ GeV. The
lower bound $M_t>150$ GeV (160 GeV)
