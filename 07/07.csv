of non-unitary directed models for localized 2D electrons tunneling in a

interference pattern between constrained-forward paths in this unitary model is
affected by the addition of phases corresponding to such a magnetic field. The
behavior is found to depend sensitively on the value of $\Phi/\Phi_{0}$, where
$\Phi$ is flux per plaquette and $\Phi_{0}$ is the unit of flux quantum. For
$\Phi/\Phi_{0} = p/q$ we find the amplitude to be more collimated the larger is
the value of $q$. We next consider propagation in a random forward scattering
media. In particular the scaling properties associated with the transverse
width $x$ of the wave, as function of its distance $t$ from point source, are
addressed. We find the moments of $x$ to scale with $t$ in a very different way
from what is known for either off-lattice unitary or on-lattice non-unitary

out or can be controlled, and one predicts asymmetries well in excess of 10\%

tests. Any failure would constitute indirect, but unequivocal evidence for the

rapidly oscillating inflaton field. We use the framework of the chaotic
inflation scenario with quartic and quadratic inflaton potentials. Particular
attention is paid to parametric resonance phenomena which take place in the
presence of the quickly oscillating inflaton field. We have found that in the
region of applicability of perturbation theory the effects of parametric
resonance are crucial, and estimates based on first order Born approximation
often underestimate the particle production. In the case of the quartic
inflaton potential $V(\varphi) = \lambda \varphi^4$, the particle production
process is very efficient even for small values of coupling constants. The
reheating temperature of the universe in this case is $\left[\lambda\, \log\,
(1/\lambda) \right]^{- 1}$ times larger than the corresponding estimates based
on first order Born approximation. In the case of the quadratic inflaton
potential the reheating process depends crucially on the type of coupling
between the inflaton and the other scalar field and on the magnitudes of the
coupling constants. If the inflaton coupling to fermions and its linear (in
inflaton field) coupling to scalar fields are suppressed, then, as previously
discussed by Kofman, Linde and Starobinsky (see e.g. Ref. 13), the inflaton
field will eventually decouple from the rest of the matter, and the residual
inflaton oscillations may provide the (cold) dark matter of the universe. In
the case of the quadratic inflaton potential we obtain the lowest and the
highest possible bounds on the effective energy density of the inflaton field

It is shown that invariance relative to $q$-deformed Hopf algebra with
deformation parameter $q$ being the fourth root of unity makes the values of
the Chern-Simons term coefficient, $k=2$, and of the coupling constant,
$g=1/2$, fixed; no collapsing solutions are present at those values.

spite of the fact that this supersymmetry does not model the infinitesimal
action of the group of gauge transformations, localization can be established
by standard arguments. The theory localizes onto reducible connections and a
careful evaluation of the fixed point contributions leads to an alternative
derivation of the Verlinde formula for the $G_{k}$ WZW model. We show that the
supersymmetry of the $G/G$ model can be regarded as an infinite dimensional
realization of Bismut's theory of equivariant Bott-Chern currents on K\""ahler
manifolds, thus providing a convenient cohomological setting for understanding
the Verlinde formula. We also show that the supersymmetry is related to a
non-linear generalization (q-deformation) of the ordinary moment map of
symplectic geometry in which a representation of the Lie algebra of a group $G$
is replaced by a representation of its group algebra with commutator $[g,h] =
gh-hg$. In the large $k$ limit it reduces to the ordinary moment map of
two-dimensional gauge theories.

derived from the dynamics on the two-dimensional unstable manifold of the
equilibrium. The mode amplitude $\rho(t)$ decouples from the phase due to the
spatial homogeneity of the equilibrium, and the resulting one-dimensional
dynamics is analyzed using an expansion in $\rho$. As the linear growth rate
$\gamma$ vanishes, the expansion coefficients diverge; a rescaling
$\rho(t)\equiv\gamma^2\,r(\gamma t)$ of the mode amplitude absorbs these
singularities and reveals that the mode electric field exhibits trapping
scaling $|E_1|\sim\gamma^2$ as $\gamma\rightarrow0$. The dynamics for $r(\tau)$
depends only on the phase $e^{i\xi}$ where $d\epsilon_{{k}}
/dz=|{\epsilon_{{k}}}|e^{-i\xi/2}$ is the derivative of the dielectric as
$\gamma\rightarrow0$.
