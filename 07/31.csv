sets for use with feature-theoretic grammars in which the value of the sets
consists of pairs of feature-theoretic categories. The algorithm preserves as
much information from the grammars as possible, using negative restriction to
define equivalence classes. Addition of a simple data structure leads to an
order of magnitude improvement in execution time over a naive implementation.

  (4 postscript figures included in a uuencoded tar-compressed separate file)",,,,"cond-mat hep-th",,"  The evolution of a single mode of the electromagnetic field interacting with
a squeezed bath in a Kerr medium is considered. The solution of the
corresponding master equation is given numerically. It is argued that the
creation of a superposition state (Schr\""odinger's cat) is better achieved in
presence of a squeezed reservoir than of a thermal one.

  1043-94",,"10.1007/BF02726159",,"cond-mat hep-th",,"  A new master equation performing isotropic phase-number squeezing is
suggested. The phase properties of coherent superpositions are analyzed when
the state evolves in presence of a bath with fluctuations squeezed in this
isotropic way. We find that such a reservoir greatly improves persistence of
coherence with respect to either a customary thermal bath, or to an
anisotropically squeezed phase-sensitive bath.

model. In the end we indicate how to generalize the given procedure.
