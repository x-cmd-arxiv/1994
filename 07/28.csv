attracting fixed point $S$. If the deterministic dynamics are perturbed by
white noise (random perturbations) of strength $\epsilon$, the system state
will eventually leave the domain of attraction $\Omega$ of $S$. We analyse the
case when, as $\epsilon\to0$, the exit location on the boundary
$\partial\Omega$ is increasingly concentrated near a saddle point $H$ of the
deterministic dynamics. We show that the asymptotic form of the exit location
distribution on $\partial\Omega$ is generically non-Gaussian and asymmetric,
and classify the possible limiting distributions. A key role is played by a
parameter $\mu$, equal to the ratio $|\lambda_s(H)|/\lambda_u(H)$ of the stable
and unstable eigenvalues of the linearized deterministic flow at $H$. If
$\mu<1$ then the exit location distribution is generically asymptotic as
$\epsilon\to0$ to a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $2/\mu$, on the
$O(\epsilon^{\mu/2})$ length scale near $H$. If $\mu>1$ it is generically
asymptotic to a distribution on the $O(\epsilon^{1/2})$ length scale, whose
moments we compute. The asymmetry of the asymptotic exit location distribution
is attributable to the generic presence of a `classically forbidden' region: a
wedge-shaped subset of $\Omega$ with $H$ as vertex, which is reached from $S$,
in the $\epsilon\to0$ limit, only via `bent' (non-smooth) fluctuational paths
that first pass through the vicinity of $H$. We deduce from the presence of
this forbidden region that the classical Eyring formula for the
small-$\epsilon$ exponential asymptotics of the mean first exit time is
generically inapplicable.

characterized by the energy of the peak of \nfn~and the evolution of this

found that this peak energy either rises with or slightly precedes major
intensity increases and softens for the remainder of the pulse. Inter-pulse
emission is generally harder early in the burst. For bursts with multiple
intensity pulses, later spikes tend to be softer than earlier ones indicating
that the energy of the peak of \nfn~is bounded by an envelope which decays with
time. Evidence is found that bursts in which the bulk of the flux comes well
after the event which triggers the instrument tend to show less peak energy
variability and are not as hard as several bursts in which the emission occurs
promptly after the trigger. Several recently proposed burst models are examined
in light of these results and no qualitative conflicts with the observations

is energetically neutral to have one interface or more. We present also some
partial results on the meaning of the integrable line for low temperatures

low-temperature expansion which may be new. We propose a new model for
numerical studies. This model has only two variables and exhibits commensurate
and incommensurate phase transitions and wetting transitions near zero
temperature. It appears to be not integrable, except at one point, and at each
temperature there is a point, where it is almost identical with the integrable

frustrated bonds (plaquettes), when the frustrated coupling $J^\prime$ exceeds
the spin canting threshold $J_c$, and weakly frustrated bonds (plaquettes),
with $J^\prime <J_c, (J_c-J^\prime)/J_c\sim 1$. It is shown that in
antiferromagnets the amplitude of spin-wave scattering on strongly frustrated
bonds or plaquettes grows with the decrease of the temperature. A small amount
of such defects reduces significantly the spin-wave stiffness and the
correlation length at low temperatures. As a result, the quasi-2D N\'eel
temperature is sharply suppressed. Quantum fluctuations are also considered and
their effect on the spin-wave spectrum is shown to be of the order of
$(2S)^{-2}\ln^{-1}2S$ in the large spin limit. For weakly frustrated

Our results do not agree with the ones obtained in the effective Lagrangian
approach. We study in detail the origin of this discrepancy, and we argue that
the use of the supertrace anomaly to determine the effective theory for the
condensate does not fix its gravitational interactions, leaving the soft
breaking terms and the vacua of the theory unspecified.

directions of a supersymmetric gauge theory. The Kahler potential of Affleck,
Dine and Seiberg is derived by applying holomorphic constraints which
manifestly maintain supersymmetry. We also present a simple procedure for
calculating all derivatives of the Kahler potential at points on the flat
direction manifold. Together with knowledge of the superpotential, these are
sufficient for a complete determination of the spectrum and the interactions of
the light degrees of freedom. We illustrate the method on the example of a
chiral abelian model, and comment on its application to more complicated
calculable models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking.

vertex operators and a one-to-one correspondence between fields and states can
be constructed. The Hilbert space of this theory is the direct sum of tensor
products of representations of the chiral algebra and finite dimensional
internal parameter spaces. On this enlarged space there exists a natural action
of Drinfeld's quasi quantum group $A_{g,t}$, which commutes with the action of
the chiral algebra and plays the r\^{o}le of an internal symmetry algebra. The
$R$ matrix describes the braiding of the chiral vertex operators and the
coassociator $\Phi$ gives rise to a modification of the duality property.
  For generic $q$ the quasi quantum group is isomorphic to the coassociative
quantum group $U_{q}(g)$ and thus the duality property of the chiral theory can
be restored. This construction has to be modified for the physically relevant
case of integer level. The quantum group has to be replaced by the
corresponding truncated quasi quantum group, which is not coassociative because
of the truncation. This exhibits the truncated quantum group as the internal
symmetry algebra of the chiral WZW model, which therefore has only a modified
duality property. The case of $g=su(2)$ is worked out in detail.

a free parameter $\beta$ which controls the strength of the coupling of the
dilaton to the Maxwell field. We obtain the energy associated with static
spherically symmetric charged dilaton black holes for arbitrary value of the
coupling parameter and find that the energy distribution depends on the value
of $\beta$. With increasing radial distance, the energy in a sphere increases
for $\beta = 0$ as well as for $\beta < 1$, decreases for $\beta > 1$, and
remains constant for $\beta = 1$. However, the total energy turns out to be the
same for all values of $\beta$.
