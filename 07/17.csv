machine for linguistic formalisms that are based on typed feature structures,
such as HPSG. The core design of the abstract machine is given in detail,
including the compilation process from a high-level specification language to
the abstract machine language and the implementation of the abstract
instructions. We thus apply methods that were proved useful in computer science
to the study of natural languages: a grammar specified using the formalism is
endowed with an operational semantics. Currently, our machine supports the
unification of simple feature structures, unification of sequences of such
structures, cyclic structures and disjunction.

bigger than a critical value, the model exhibits an oblique confinement phase,
which we identify with Lauglin's incompressible quantum fluid. For M smaller
than the critical value, we obtain a phase transition to a Coulomb phase or a
confinement phase, depending on the value of the electromagnetic coupling.

backgrounds (admitting a covariantly constant null Killing vector) and
`$F$-models' (backgrounds with two null Killing vectors generalising the
`fundamental string' solution). The recently constructed $D=4$ solutions with
Minkowski signature are given explicitly. We consider various relations between
these solutions and, in particular, discuss some aspects of the duality
symmetry. [To appear in the Proceedings of the 2nd Journe'e Cosmologie,

evolution of a constant incoming energy flux turned on at a point in the past

discovered phase transition in this system via numerical methods
\cite{choptuik} is manifest; above a threshold value of the incooming energy
flux, a black hole is dynamically formed and below that, the incoming flux is
reflected forward into the future null infinity. The critical exponent is
evaluated and discussed using the solutions.

"math/9407204","Joerg Brendle","J\""org Brendle","Strolling through Paradise",,,,"Logic E-prints July 17, 1994","math.LO",,"  With each of the usual tree forcings I (e.g., I = Sacks forcing S, Laver
forcing L, Miller forcing M, Mathias forcing R, etc.) we associate a
sigma--ideal i^0 on the reals as follows: A \in i^0 iff for all T \in I there
is S \leq T (i.e. S is stronger than T or, equivalently, S is a subtree of T)
such that A \cap [S] = \emptyset, where [S] denotes the set of branches through
S. So, s^0 is the ideal of Marczewski null sets, r^0 is the ideal of Ramsey
null sets (nowhere Ramsey sets) etc.
  We show (in ZFC) that whenever i^0, j^0 are two such ideals, then i^0 \sem
j^0 \neq \emptyset. E.g., for I=S and J=R this gives a Marczewski null set
which is not Ramsey, extending earlier partial results by Aniszczyk,
Frankiewicz, Plewik, Brown and Corazza and answering a question of the latter.
In case I=M and J=L this gives a Miller null set which is not Laver null; this
answers a question addressed by Spinas.
  We also investigate the question which pairs of the ideals considered are
orthogonal and which are not.
  Furthermore we include Mycielski's ideal P_2 in our discussion.

In particular, we show that if V \sub W are models of ZFC and W contains a
dominating real over V, then W[r], where r is random over W, contains a perfect
tree of mutually random reals over V. This result improves an earlier result by
Bartoszynski and Judah and sheds new light on an old Theorem of Mycielski's.
  We also investigate the existence of perfect free subsets for projective
functions f: (omega^omega)^n \to omega^omega. In particular, we prove that
every projective function has a perfect free subset in the Cohen real model,
while in the Sacks real model the following holds: every Delta^1_2-- function
f: omega^omega \to omega^omega has a perfect free subset and there is a
Delta^1_2--function f: (omega^omega)^2 \to omega^omega without perfect free
subsets. This is connected with recent results of Mildenberger.
  Finally, we show that the existence of a superperfect tree of Cohen reals
over a model V of ZFC implies the existence of a dominating real over V, thus
answering a question addressed by Spinas.
