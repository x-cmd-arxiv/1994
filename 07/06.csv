from the pulsars 0833-45 (Vela), 0656+14, 0630+178 (Geminga), and 1055-52.
  The composite blackbody spectra obtained are not very different from a black-
body spectrum at the star's effective temperature: temperature estimates using
single temperature models are practically equivalent to composite model
results.
  Gravitational lensing strongly suppresses the light curve pulsations: this
may be a new tool to constrain the size of neutron stars.
  Dipolar surface fields yield many features somewhat similar to the observed
ones but are not sufficient for an accurate description.
  The pulsed fractions obtained in all our models increase with photon energy:
the strong decrease observed in Geminga at energies 0.3 - 0.5 keV is definitely
a genuine effect of the atmospheric magnetic field on the locally emitted
spectrum in contradistinction to the magnetic effects on the surface
temperature.
  A complete model will have to consider complex surface field structures and
include effects of the atmospheric magnetic field on the emitted spectrum.

Hamiltonians is proven to contain a spin singlet (for an even number of
electrons on a finite lattice). The phonons interact with the electronic system
in two different ways---there is an interaction with the local electronic
charge and there is a functional dependence of the electronic hopping
Hamiltonian on the phonon coordinates. The phonon potential energy may include
anharmonic terms, and the electron-phonon couplings and the hopping matrix
elements may be nonlinear functions of the phonon coordinates. If the hopping
Hamiltonian is assumed to have no phonon coordinate dependence, then the ground
state is also shown to be unique, implying that there are no ground-state level
crossings, and that the ground-state energy is an analytic function of the
parameters in the Hamiltonian. In particular, in a finite system any
self-trapping transition is a smooth crossover not accompanied by a
nonanalytical change in the ground state. The spin-singlet theorem applies to
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and both the spin-singlet and uniqueness
theorems apply to the Holstein and attractive Hubbard models as special cases.

this mapping the spontaneous symmetry breaking is equivalent to that of a spin

can be neutral or carry charge e. We derive an effective low-energy action and
use it to discuss the charged and collective neutral excitations of the system.

concerning the existence of metrics of positive scalar curvature. It says that
a closed spin manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 5$ has such a metric if and only
if the index of a suitable ``Dirac"" operator in $KO_n(C^* (\pi_1(M)))$, the
real $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of the fundamental group of $M$,
vanishes. It is known that the vanishing of the index is necessary for
existence of a positive scalar curvature metric on $M$, but this is known to be
a sufficient condition only if $\pi_1(M)$ is the trivial group, $\Bbb Z/2$, an
odd order cyclic group, or one of a fairly small class of torsion-free groups.
\par We note that the groups $KO_n(C^*(\pi))$ are periodic in $n$ with period
$8$, whereas there is no obvious periodicity in the original geometric problem.
This leads us to introduce a ``stable'' version of the Gromov-Lawson
conjecture, which makes the weaker statement that the product of $M$ with
enough copies of the ``Bott manifold"" $B$ has a positive scalar curvature
metric if and only if the index of the Dirac operator on $M$ vanishes. (Here
$B$ is a simply connected $8$-manifold which represents the periodicity element
in $KO_8(pt)$.) We prove the stable Gromov-Lawson conjecture for all spin
manifolds with finite fundamental group and for many spin manifolds with

this order was left as an open question. In this paper, we answer this question
with the help of a nonrelativistic effective field theory, NRQED. We find that,
aside from infrared terms which had to be discarded without justification in
Zhang et al, the order m \alpha^4 and m \alpha^5 calculations give the same
results in both methods. It is shown, however, that this is due to the special
physical origin of these contributions and that the method of Zhang et al would
not give the right answer at order m \alpha^6 or higher. The separation of
scale provided by NRQED is essential to the derivation of this result.

satisfy a $W_\infty$ current algebra. The gluon sector (closed strings)
contains purely quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. The description of this

spectrum of excitations of the full theory is therefore organized according to
two different algebras: a wedge subalgebra of $W_\infty$ current algebra in the
meson sector and a wedge subalgebra of $W_\infty$ algebra in the glueball
sector. In the large $N$ limit the theory becomes semiclassical and an
effective description for the gluon degrees of freedom can be obtained. We have
solved the effective theory of the gluons in the small $L$ limit. We get a
glueball spectrum which coincides with the `discrete states' of the (Euclidean)
