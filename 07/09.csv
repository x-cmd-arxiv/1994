context, and driven asymptotically by the free dilaton field without any

penetrated by an Aharonov-Bohm flux are discussed. The sensitivity of the
electron-density distribution to small variations in the flux generates an
effective electro-static potential which is itself a periodic function of flux.
We investigate a simple model in which the flux sensitive potential leads to a
persistent current which is enhanced compared to that of a loop of
non-interacting electrons. For sample geometries with contacts the sensitivity
of the electro-static potential to flux leads to a flux-induced capacitance.
This capacitance gives the variation in charge due to an increment in flux. The
flux-induced capacitance is contrasted with the electro-chemical capacitance
which gives the variation in charge due to an increment in an electro-chemical
potential. The discussion is formulated in terms of characteristic functions
which give the variation of the electro-static potential in the interior of the
conductor due to an increment in the external control parameters (flux,
electro-chemical potentials). Paper submitted to the 16th Nordic Semiconductor

approximation becomes exact in the very early time regime (or the
reaction-controlled limit) and in the long time (diffusion-controlled)
asymptotic limit. For the intermediate time regime, we obtain a simple
interpolative behavior between these two limits. We also study the coalescence
process (with finite reaction rates) with the back reaction $A\to A+A$, and in
the presence of particle input. In each of these cases the system reaches a
non-trivial steady state with a finite concentration of particles. Theoretical

cases -- K is a compact simple Lie group, and K is an affine Lie group.
  We construct such functions as weighted traces of certain intertwining
operators between representations of K. For a compact group $K$, Peter-Weyl
theorem implies that all equivariant functions can be written as linear
combinations of such traces. Next, we compute the radial parts of the Laplace
operators of $K$ acting on conjugacy equivariant functions and obtain a comple-
tely integrable quantum system with matrix coefficients, which in a special
case coincides with the trigonometric Calogero-Sutherland-Moser multi-particle
system. In the affine Lie group case, we prove that the space of equivariant
functions having a fixed homogeneity degree with respect to the action of the
center of the group is finite-dimensional and spanned by weighted traces of
intertwining operators. This space coincides with the space of
Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal blocks on an elliptic curve. We compute the radial
part of the second order Laplace operator on the affine Lie group acting on
equivariant functions, and find that it is a certain parabolic partial
differential operator, which degenerates to the elliptic
Calogero-Sutherland-Moser hamiltonian as the central charge tends to minus the
dual Coxeter number (the critical level). Quantum integrals of this hamiltonian
are obtained as radial part of the higher Sugawara operators which are central
at the critical level.
