evidence of Be and B synthesis by early galactic cosmic rays. However, a recent
reanalysis of the boron abundance in the Pop II halo star HD140283 suggests
that B/H may be larger than previously reported, by as much as a factor of 4.
This would yield a B/Be ratio lying in the range $14 \la {\rm B/Be} \la 50$.
The possibility of a high Pop II B/Be ratio stresses the importance of the
upper limit to the B/Be ratio arising from cosmic ray production. It is found
that the limit to cosmic ray-produced B/Be depends upon the assumed cosmic ray
spectrum. For any Pop II comic ray spectrum that is a single power law in
either total energy per nucleon or in momentum the B/Be ratio is constrained to
lie in the range $7.6 \la$ B/Be $\la 14$. Thus, if the new B/Be ratio is
correct, it requires either a bimodal cosmic ray flux with a large low energy
component, or for another B source, possibly the proposed $\nu$-process in
supernovae, either of which may be helpful in explaining the observed
\bor11/\bor10 ratio. Finally, it is noted that the boron reanalysis highlights
the uncertainty in our knowledge of the B/Be ratio, and the need for additional
data on Be and B abundances.

  ftp from pub/marc/itf on magicbean.berkeley.edu, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/276.4.1391",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a method for deriving a smoothed estimate of the peculiar velocity
field of a set of galaxies with measured circular velocities $\eta\equiv {\rm
log} \Delta v$ and apparent magnitudes $m$. The method is based on minimizing
the scatter of a linear inverse Tully-Fisher relation $\eta= \eta(M)$ where the
absolute magnitude of each galaxy is inferred from its redshift $z$, corrected
by a peculiar velocity field, $M \propto m - 5\log(z-u)$. We describe the
radial peculiar velocity field $u({\bf z})$ in terms of a set of orthogonal
functions which can be derived from any convenient basis set; as an example we
take them to be linear combinations of low order spherical harmonic and
spherical Bessel functions. The model parameters are then found by maximizing
the likelihood function for measuring a set of observed $\eta$. The predicted
peculiar velocities are free of Malmquist bias in the absence of
multi-streaming, provided no selection criteria are imposed on the measurement
of circular velocities. This procedure can be considered as a generalized
smoothing algorithm of the peculiar velocity field, and is particularly useful
for comparison to the smoothed gravity field derived from full-sky galaxy
redshift catalogs such as the IRAS surveys. We demonstrate the technique using
a catalog of ``galaxies"" derived from an N-body simulation. Increasing the
resolution of the velocity smoothing beyond a certain level degrades the
correlation of fitted velocities against the velocities calculated from linear
theory methods, which have finite resolution,

parametrization for the r-space structure function and a common parametrization
for the energy spectrum, $E(p)\propto p^{-5/3}\exp(-p/p_d)$, are examined and
compared. In particular, we investigate corrections to the local scaling
exponents induced by finite size effects. The behavior of local r-- and
p--space exponents differs dramatically. The Batchelor type parametrization
leads to energy pileups in p-space at the ends of the ISR. These bottleneck
effects result in an extended r-space scaling range, comparable to experimental
ones for the same Taylor-Reynolds number $\rel$. Shear effects are discussed in
terms of (global) apparent scaling correction $\delta\zeta^{app}$ to classical
scaling. The scaling properties of $\delta\zeta^{app}(\rel )$ differ not only
among the parametrizations considered, but also among r-- and p--space for a
{\it given} parametrization. The difference can be traced back to the
subtleties of the crossovers in the velocity moments. Our observations
emphasize the need for more experimental information on crossovers between
different subranges.

commonly encountered objects, processes, qualities, and relations. The ontology
was constructed by merging various online dictionaries, semantic networks, and
bilingual resources, through semi-automatic methods. Some of these methods
(e.g., conceptual matching of semantic taxonomies) are broadly applicable to
problems of importing/exporting knowledge from one KB to another. Other methods
(e.g., bilingual matching) allow a knowledge engineer to build up an index to a

understood on the basis of a simple counting rule: $O(1/N_c)\sim\ O(m_q)$. It
is shown how this counting rule eventually allows one to include the $\eta'$
into the effective lagrangian in a consistent and systematic way.

At finite temperature, a crucial role is played by the damping rate of
quasi-quarks in a hot plasma, which induces loss of spatial coherence and
suppresses reflection on the boundary even at tree-level. The resulting baryon
asymmetry is many orders of magnitude below what observation requires. We
comment as well on related works.
