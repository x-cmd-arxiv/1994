whether the core of the initial galaxy does or does not resemble that of an
isothermal sphere. For the isothermal case the previously-known results are
confirmed and sharpened: the black hole induces cusps in the density ($\rho\sim
r^{-3/2}$) and velocity dispersion ($v^2\sim r^{-1}$), and a tangential
anisotropy in the velocity distribution away from the center. For the
non-isothermal case the induced density cusp is steeper, and the induced
anisotropy is larger and penetrates right to the center. The cusp around the
black hole is insensitive to anisotropy in the initial velocity distribution,
and also to the origin of the black hole, unless its mass comes exclusively
from the stars of lowest angular momentum, in which case the cusp is
suppressed. We discuss the implications for the interpretation of evidence for
massive black holes in galactic nuclei.

$SU(N)$, pure Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory and the physics of the phase of
the Wilson line expectation value. In the high $T$ phase, $\langle L \rangle$
takes one of $N$ distinct values proportional to the $Nth$ roots of unity in
$Z(N)$, and the $Z(N)$ symmetry is broken. Only one of these is consistent with
the usual interpretation $\langle L \rangle = e^{-F/T}$. This relation should
be generalized to $\langle L \rangle = z e^{-F/T}$ with $z \in Z(N)$ so that it
is consistent with the negative or complex values. In the Hamiltonian
description, the {\em physical} variables are the group elements on the links
of the spatial lattice. In a Lagrangian formulation, there are also group
elements on links in the inverse-temperature direction from which the Wilson
line is constructed. These are unphysical, auxiliary variables introduced to
enforce the Gauss law constraints. The following results are obtained: The
relation $\langle L \rangle=ze^{-F/T}$ is derived. The value of $z \in Z(N)$ is
determined by the external field that is needed for the infinite-volume limit.
There is a single physical, high-temperature phase, which is the same for all
$z$. The global $Z(N)$ symmetry is not physical; it acts as the identity on all
physical states. In the Hamiltonian formulation, the high-temperature phase is
not distinguished by physical broken symmetry but rather by percolating flux.
