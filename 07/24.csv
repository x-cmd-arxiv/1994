Bekenstein-Milgrom formulation of MOND as a modification of Newtonian gravity.
Analytic solutions are found for the full gravitational fields of Kuzmin disks,
and of disk-plus-bulge generalizations of them.
  For all these models a simple algebraic relation between the MOND potential
field and the Newtonian potential holds everywhere outside the disk. We give
exact expressions for the rotation curves for these models. We also find that
the algebraic relation is a very good approximation for exponential disks. The
algebraic relation outside the disk is then extended into the disk to derive an
improved approximation for the MOND rotation curve of disk galaxies that
requires only knowledge of the Newtonian curve and the surface density.

  (figures upon request)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The most simple observed cases of gravitational lensing of distant quasars
and galaxies by galaxies and clusters of galaxies are used to test Einstein's
theory of General Relativity and Newtonian Gravity over galactic and
intergalactic distances. They extend the distance range over which
Newton-Einstein Gravity has been tested by 10 orders of magnitude. Although the
precision of the tests are far from the precision of the solar system tests of
EGR and those from pulsar timing in close binary systems, they confirm quite
accurately the validity of Einstein's General Relativity and its weak field
limit, Newtonian Gravity, over galactic and intergalactic distances and the
existence of large quantities of dark matter in galaxies and clusters of
galaxies. Future observations can improve the accuracy of the tests and reduce
the possibilities for systematic errors.

  with 1 separate colour postscript figure. To appear in the Proceedings of the
  CWRU CMB Workshop `2 years after COBE' eds. L. Krauss & P. Kernan",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Fluctuations in the CMB have now been detected over a wide range of angular
scales, and a consistent picture seems to be emerging. The data cannot
currently constrain a large number of cosmological parameters, but it is clear
that there is more information than just the normalization of the models. Here
we use the data to constrain a second parameter, namely the amplitude of the
Doppler peak, using a phenomenological approach to the power spectrum. We find
that the data prefer a peak of height ~3, with a purely flat spectrum ruled out
at the 95%CL. Although there are concerns about possible foregrounds and
non-Gaussian fluctuations, we believe that the existence of a peak at
degree-scales is established by the data. This immediately implies that
reionization was unimportant for the CMB. It also potentially leads to
difficulties for models where the fluctuations were produced by topological
defects. Independent constraints on Omega_B, on the slope n, etc. will need to
wait for further data. At the moment, the simple presence of a Doppler peak
should be seen as strong supporting evidence for standard dark matter-dominated
models with some few percent of baryons at z=1000.

information retrieval, content analysis, natural language processing, and other
tasks involving data which is partly or fully textual. An algorithm for
sequential sampling during machine learning of statistical classifiers was
developed and tested on a newswire text categorization task. This method, which
we call uncertainty sampling, reduced by as much as 500-fold the amount of
training data that would have to be manually classified to achieve a given
level of effectiveness.

Tunneling
mixes different charge states and in the nonperturbative regime the charge in
the island may be strongly screened. When charge states are nearly degenerate
the screening of the charge is strong even in the weak tunneling regime.
Virtual tunneling processes reduce both the level splitting and the tunneling
strength. The charge on the island and the decay rates are calculated. In the
strong tunneling regime also nondegenerate states are affected by tunneling.
Strong-coupling scaling renormalizes the effective capacitance, a result which
we confirm by Monte Carlo simulations. The tunneling strength scales to smaller
values into the regime where the weak-coupling scaling applies. We propose a
two stage scaling procedure providing the unified picture for the problem. The
scaling analysis is also extended to superconducting tunnel junctions with
finite subgap conductance. (9 figures upon request)
