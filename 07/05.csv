  Astrophysics Meeting, ``Clusters of Galaxies'', M\'eribel, 12-19 March 1994",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The conjecture that dark matter in galaxies is mostly cold fractal gas is
developed in the more general context of the thermodynamics of the ideal
isothermal gas subject to gravitational instability. This simple gas model
already contains the contrary ingredients able to prevent an asymptotic
equilibrium: any growing gravothermal singularity evaporates in a finite time,
and any tendency to uniform gas is gravitationally unstable. The paradox is
simply resolved by allowing fractal states, which are then scale-free and
steady {\it in average}, but non-differentiable and time-dependent. If we apply
to clusters the lessons learned with galaxies, we are led to the conclusion
that gas in clusters at a temperature much below the virial temperature should
also adopt a fractal structure and become inhomogeneous. The same instrumental
biases acting at galactic scale and preventing the detection of the smallest
and coldest sub-resolution clumps in the fractal are then even more relevant
for cluster gas measurements. The large baryonic mass observed in the cluster
hot gas and the morphology-density relation suggest also gaseous dark matter in
spirals. If this dark gas component remains undetected in spirals, the same
instrumental biases should hold in clusters, where cooling hot gas disappears
from detection near the centre.

solutions for each specific theory can be obtained by transforming back to the
original canonical representation, and the conversions are given for the
theories of Jordan-Brans-Dicke, Barker, Schwinger, and conformally invariant

developed, which includes as special case the spherically symmetric solutions

theory is accomplished by the introduction of a transverse part to the

a similar behaviour for small values of total energy thrown in. However, when
the total energy exceeds another critical value, the boundary exibits a runaway
behaviour and the spacetime devolopes singularities and horizons.

quantization of the theory is carried out in the Hamiltonian formalism and
explicit solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation are obtained. We show that the
Hilbert space is finite dimensional and the physical states carry a
one-dimensional projective representation of the local gauge symmetries. When
$\MT$ is homologically non-trivial the wavefunctions in addition carry a
multi-dimensional projective representation, in terms of the linking matrix of
the homology cycles of $\MT$, of the discrete group of large gauge
transformations. The wavefunctions also carry a one-dimensional representation
of the non-trivial linking of the particle trajectories and string surfaces in
$\MT$. This topological field theory therefore provides a phenomenological
generalization of anyons to (3 + 1) dimensions where the holonomies
representing fractional statistics arise from the adiabatic transport of
particles around strings. We also discuss a duality between large gauge
transformations and these linking operations around the homology cycles of
$\MT$, and show that this canonical quantum field theory provides novel quantum
representations of the cohomology of $\MT$ and its associated motion group.

based on redefinitions $\delta\lambda$ of the parameters $\lambda$ of the
classical Lagrangian and canonical transformations, by generalizing a well-
known conjecture on the form of the divergent terms. We also show that it is
possible to reach a complete control on the effects of the subtraction
algorithm on the space ${\cal M}_{gf}$ of the gauge-fixing parameters. A
principal fiber bundle ${\cal E}\rightarrow {\cal M}_{gf}$ with a connection
$\omega_1$ is defined, such that the canonical transformations are gauge
transformations for $\omega_1$. This provides an intuitive geometrical
description of the fact the on shell physical amplitudes cannot depend on
${\cal M}_{gf}$. A geometrical description of the effect of the subtraction
algorithm on the space ${\cal M}_{ph}$ of the physical parameters $\lambda$ is
also proposed. At the end, the full subtraction algorithm can be described as a
series of diffeomorphisms on ${\cal M}_{ph}$, orthogonal to ${\cal M}_{gf}$
(under which the action transforms as a scalar), and gauge transformations on
${\cal E}$. In this geometrical context, a suitable concept of predictivity is
formulated. We give some examples of (unphysical) toy models that satisfy this
requirement, though being neither power counting renormalizable, nor finite.

plays in the $N=2$ superconformal theories, is played by tri-critical Ising
model in the case of $G_2$ and Ising model in the case of $Spin(7)$ manifolds.
