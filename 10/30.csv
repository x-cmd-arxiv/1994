neutrinos from shock-reheating and r-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. To
this end neutrino flavor evolution is described by nonlinear equations
following from a quantum kinetic approach. This takes into account neutrino
forward scattering off the neutrino background itself. In contrast to other
claims in the literature it is shown that a sound self-consistent analytical
approximation can in the first place only be performed in the adiabatic limit
where phase terms are suppressed. In the cosmologically interesting mass range
below about $25\eV$ the resulting mixing parameter bounds are between one and
two orders of magnitude less restrictive than limits neglecting neutrino
contributions. Extensions to the non-adiabatic regime derived in the literature
usually neglect coherence effects from phases. To check their importance
numerical simulations of the evolution equations were performed in this regime.
They indicate that analytical approximations for the flavor conversion
efficiencies can indeed be extended by neglecting phase terms. This allows more
stringent bounds similar to the ones derived in earlier work. These bounds
depend to some extent on the adopted supernova model and tend to be somewhat
less restrictive in the mixing angle but simultaneously extend to smaller
mixing masses compared to limits neglecting the neutrino induced potential.

that they provide a powerful discriminator between cosmological models. We
apply these to high-resolution PM N-body simulations of structure formation in
CHDM (cold/hot/baryon fractions=.6/.3/.1, b=1.5 (COBE norm) and two CDM models;
b=1.5 and b=1.0 (COBE norm). Groups are identified with the Nolthenius (1993)
algorithm. We find: (1) Properties of groups are a powerful and robust
discriminator between these Gaussian models whose spatial and velocity
properties differ on Mpc scales. We test robustness against several methods for
assigning luminosity to dark matter halos, for merging CfA1 galaxies, and for
breaking up massive over-mergers (2) When allowance is made for the high large
scale power P(k) present in the CfA1 data, CHDM at our $\Omnu=0.30$ produces
slightly too many groups and groups too high a fraction of the galaxies, while
the fraction grouped in CDM is far too low. Lowering $\Omnu$ would appear to
produce close agreement with all measures, save one: for all simulations,
median group sizes are x1.4-1.7 larger than equivalently selected CfA1 groups.
(3) The standard group M/L method gives $\Omega\simeq 0.1$ for CHDM and CfA1,
and $\Omega\simeq 0.35$ for CDM. A conspiracy of three effects produce these
very low values, and we conclude that low observed $\Omega$'s need not argue
for a low $\Omega$ universe. When overmergers are broken up, the median virial-
to-DM mass of 3D selected groups is $\sim1$ for all simulations.
$M_{DM}>10^{14}\Msun$ groups appear virialized in all simulations. Global
velocity biases $b_v$ are similar to previous studies. Within 3D-selected
groups, CHDM and CDM b=1.5 show a stronger bias of $b_v=0.7-0.8$, while CDM
b=1.0 shows group $b_v$'s $\simeq 1$.

Phys., 175 (1996) 565-606","10.1007/BF02099509",,"cond-mat",,"  We prove that for any finite set of generalized valence bond solid (GVBS)
states of a quantum spin chain there exists a translation invariant
finite-range Hamiltonian for which this set is the set of ground states. This
result implies that there are GVBS models with arbitrary broken discrete
symmetries that are described as combinations of lattice translations, lattice
reflections, and local unitary or anti-unitary transformations. We also show
that all GVBS models that satisfy some natural conditions have a spectral gap.
The existence of a spectral gap is obtained by applying a simple and quite
general strategy for proving lower bounds on the spectral gap of the generator
of a classical or quantum spin dynamics. This general scheme is interesting in
its own right and therefore, although the basic idea is not new, we present it
in a system-independent setting. The results are illustrated with an number of
examples.

gravitation theory leads to geometry of a space-time which is far from
simplicity of pseudo-Riemannian geometry of Einstein's General Relativity. This
is geometry of the affine-metric composite dislocated manifolds. The goal is
modification of the familiar equations of a gravitational field and entirely
the new equations of its deviations. In the present brief, we do not detail the
mathematics, but discuss the reasons why it is just this geometry. The major
physical underlying reason lies in spontaneous symmetry breaking when the
fermion matter admits only the Lorentz subgroup of world symmetries of the
geometric arena.

that predict the critical properties of statistical systems in hyperspherical
geometries. To that end, it was shown how to reduce a random walk in $D$
dimensions to an anisotropic one-dimensional random walk on concentric
hyperspheres. Here, I construct such a random walk to model the
adsorption-desorption transition of polymer chains growing near an attractive
cylindrical boundary such as that of a cell membrane. I find that the fraction
of adsorbed monomers on the boundary vanishes exponentially when the adsorption
energy decreases towards its critical value. When the adsorption energy rises
beyond a certain value above the critical point whose scale is set by the
radius of the cell, the adsorption fraction exhibits a crossover to a linear
increase characteristic to polymers growing near planar boundaries.
