existing surveys of the distribution of Ti$^+$ to larger distances from the

titanium to be determined for the first time. We find $h_{Ti^+} = 1.5 \pm
0.2$~kpc, a value which although greater than those of other tracers of neutral
gas, is not as large as had been suspected. We interpret the extended
distribution of Ti$^+$ as an indication that its severe depletion in
interstellar clouds in the disk is reduced at the lower densities prevailing in
the halo. The data are consistent with a simple power-law dependence of the Ti
abundance on the ambient density, with exponent $k \simeq -1$. If the model is
correct, it implies that refractory elements like Ti are fully returned to the
gas phase at distances beyond $\sim 1$ kpc from the plane of the Galaxy.

(FWHM 33 \kms) of the nucleus of NGC 4526 and the supernova, obtained with the
WHT at La Palma, and 21 cm spectra obtained with the 100 m Effelsberg
Radiotelescope in the field of NGC 4526.
  The velocity of the gas in NGC 4526 determined from our \halpha\ spectra is
+625 \kms\ at the centre and +880 \kms\ at the supernova position. Our value of
the systemic velocity is higher than the previous value of +450 \kms.
  In our high resolution spectra we detect Ca\II\ and Na\I\ absorption at +714
\kms\ which is produced in interstellar gas in NGC 4526. To our knowledge this
is the first detection of interstellar absorption originating in a galaxy of
early morphological type. We detect multi-component
  Ca\II\ and Na\I\ absorption lines in the range from +204 to +254 \kms\ which
originate in a complex of High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) located at a distance
$\ll$ 1 Mpc, in the surroundings of the Milky Way. The gas appears to have near
solar abundances, low dust content, and a diluted UV radiation field. At $-$29
\kms, we find weak Ca\II\ absorption and weak H\I\ emission. This component may
originate in gas infalling onto the Galactic disk. Finally, close to rest
velocity, we find both warm and cold gas located beyond 65 pc, probably
associated with high latitude gas at the border of Loop I. The total reddening
of the supernova, estimated using the standard Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio, is
$E$(B$-$V) $\simeq$ 0.05.

  preprint","Astron.Astrophys.299:11,1995",,,"astro-ph",,"  It is shown in this paper that deviations of galaxy cluster lenses from
spherical symmetry can render mass estimates for galaxy clusters based on the
formation of large arcs systematically to high. Numerical models show that the
mass needed for producing large arcs in clusters can be notably smaller than
expected from simple spherically symmetric lens models. The reason is that the
enhanced tidal effect in asymmetric and substructured lenses can compensate for
part of the convergence necessary for strong lensing effects. An analytic
argument is given to explain why deviations from radial symmetry will in
general decrease the required lens mass. Mass estimates assuming radially
symmetric lenses are on average too high by a factor of $\simeq1.6$, and with a
probability of $\simeq20\%$ by a factor of $\simeq2$.

an open Fermi surface} are expected to be unusual in a magnetic field. On the
one hand, the quasi-1D structure of the Fermi surface strongly favors the
formation of a non-uniform state (Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell (LOFF)
state) in the presence of a magnetic field acting on the electron spins. On the
other hand, a magnetic field acting on an open Fermi surface induces a
dimensional crossover by confining the electronic wave-functions wave-functions
along the chains of highest conductivity, which results in a divergence of the
orbital critical field and in a stabilization at low temperature of a cascade
of superconducting phases separated by first order transistions. In this paper,
we study the phase diagram as a function of the anisotropy. We discuss in
details the experimental situation in the quasi-1D organic conductors of the
Bechgaard salts family and argue that they appear as good candidates for the
observation of the LOFF state, provided that their anisotropy is large enough.
Recent experiments on the organic quasi-1D superconductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$

interpreted as a signature of a high-field superconducting phase. We also point
out the possibility to observe a LOFF state in some quasi-2D organic

$Z$, are examined in the case of unpolarized and longitudinally polarized
electrons. The new asymmetries measured together with the old ones can help to
determine independently the real and imaginary parts of the electric as well as
weak dipole couplings. Longitudinal beam polarization, if present, obviates the
need for the simultaneous measurement of more than one asymmetry, and enhances
considerably the sensitivity to the CP-violating parameters. Numerical results
are presented for the Next Linear Collider with $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and
$\int{\cal L}\,dt\;=\;10\,{\rm fb}^{-1}$.

framework of the Lagrangian formalism. Three equivalent Lagrangians are
obtained for this system which are endowed with $q$-deformed local (super)gauge
symmetries and reparametrization invariance. It is demonstrated that these
symmetries are on-shell equivalent only for $ q = \pm1 $ under particular
identification of the transformation parameters. The same condition ($ q=\pm1
$) emerges due to the requirement that the $q$-commutator of two supersymmetric
gauge transformations should generate a reparametrization plus a supersymmetric
gauge transformation. For a specific gauge choice, the solutions for equations
of motion respect $GL_{\surd q}(1|1)$ and $GL_{q}(2)$ invariances for any
arbitrary value of the evolution parameter characterizing the quantum super
world-line.

integrability, is derived from Hirota's bilinear difference equation. The
integrability of the map is shown to result from the large symmetry associated
with the B\""acklund transformation of the KP hierarchy. We introduce a scheme
which interpolates between this map and the standard logistic map and enables
us to study integrable and nonintegrable systems on an equal basis. In
particular we study the behavior of Julia set at the point where the
nonintegrable map passes to the integrable map.
