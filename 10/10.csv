simulate the low temperature behavior of diluted Ising-antiferromagnets by a
Monte Carlo simulation considering long range interaction. The metamagnetic
domain structure occurring due to the dipole interaction is investigated by
graphical representation. In the model considered the antiferromagnetic state
is stable for an external magnetic field smaller than a lower boundary $B_{c1}$
while for fields larger than an upper boundary $B_{c2}$ the system is in the
saturated paramagnetic phase, where the spins are ferromagnetically polarized.
For magnetic fields in between these two boundaries a mixed phase occurs
consisting of ferromagnetic domains in an antiferromagnetic background. The
position of these ferromagnetic domains is stored in the system: after a cycle
in which the field is first removed and afterwards applied again the domains
reappear at their original positions. The reason for this effect can be found
in the frozen antiferromagnetic domain state which occurs after removing the

paper, we present a model which describes this intrinsic Josephson coupling in
terms of incoherent quasiparticle hopping along the c-axis arising from
wave-function overlap, impurity-assisted hopping, and boson-assisted hopping.
We use this model to compute the magnitude and temperature T dependence of the
resulting Josephson critical current j_c (T) for s- and d-wave superconductors.
Contrary to other approaches, d-wave pairing in this model is compatible with
an intrinsic Josephson effect at all hole concentrations and leads to j_c (T)
\propto T at low T. By parameterizing our theory with c-axis resistivity data
from YBCO, we estimate j_c (T) for optimally doped and underdoped members of
this family. Our estimates suggest that further experiments on this compound

the pairing symmetry in particular. We also discuss the implications of our

hadron physics and M_{127} leptohadron physics. Leptons and U type quarks are
predicted to have light colored excitations. The anomalous production of e^+e^-
pairs in heavy ion collisions sup- ports the existence of light leptomeson but
there are objections against light exotics. a) Asymptotic freedom in the
standard sense might be lost: the recently identified exotic color bosons
however save the situation. b) Z^0 decay width seems to exclude light exotics.
The solution of the problem relies on p-adic probability concept. The real
counterpart (\sum_jP(ito j))_R for the sum of p-adic probabi- lities differs
from the sum \sum_j P(i toj)_R for the real counter- parts of p-adic
probabilities. Interpretation:(\sum_jP(i to j))_R is used, when only a common
signature for final states is used. \sum_j(P(i to j)_R is used, when each final
state is monitored separately. The total decay rate of $Z^0$ to unmonitored
exotic leptons is sensitive to the value of \theta_W(eff) and vanishes for
sin^2(\theta_W(eff))=0.2324 and sensible value of \alpha_s(L)! In TGD the
observed top quark candidate most probably corresponds to u and d quarks of

systems which describe charged scalar fields in $2+1$ dimensions coupled to a
gauge field whose dynamics is provided by a pure Chern-Simons Lagrangian. These
self-dual models have one realization with nonrelativistic dynamics for the
scalar fields, and another with relativistic dynamics for the scalars. In each
model, the energy density may be minimized by a Bogomol'nyi bound which is
saturated by solutions to a set of first-order self-duality equations. In the
nonrelativistic case the self-dual potential is quartic, the system possesses a
dynamical conformal symmetry, and the self-dual solutions are equivalent to the
static zero energy solutions of the equations of motion. The nonrelativistic
self-duality equations are integrable and all finite charge solutions may be
found. In the relativistic case the self-dual potential is sixth order and the
self-dual Lagrangian may be embedded in a model with an extended supersymmetry.
The self-dual potential has a rich structure of degenerate classical minima,
and the vacuum masses generated by the Chern-Simons Higgs mechanism reflect the
self-dual nature of the potential.

model with the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms as its gauge group.
Using this formulation, it is shown that self-dual gravity contains an infinite
dimensional hidden symmetry whose generators form the Affine (Kac-Moody)
algebra associated with the Lie algebra of area preserving diffeomorphisms.
This result provides an observable algebra and a solution generating technique
for self-dual gravity.

We find that coupling to fermions nontrivially modifies the large $N$ saddle
point of the gauge theory due to the phenomenon of `decompactification' of
eigenvalues of the gauge field. We calculate the vacuum energy and the vacuum
expectation value of the Wilson loop operator both of which show a nontrivial
dependence on the number of quarks flavours at the leading order in $1/N$.
