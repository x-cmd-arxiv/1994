non-linear entropy fluctuations. Overdense regions, with masses above the local
baryon-Jeans mass, are expected to collapse and form condensed objects.
Surviving nucleosynthesis products therefore tend to originate from underdense
regions. We compute expected surviving light element ($^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He,
$^7$Li) abundance yields for a variety of stochastic fluctuation spectra. In
general, we find that spectra with significant power in fluctuations on length
scales below that of the local baryon Jeans mass produce nucleosynthesis yields
which are in conflict with observationally inferred primordial abundances.
However, when this small scale structure is absent or suppressed, and the
collapse efficiency of overdense regions is high, there exists a range of
fluctuation spectral characteristics which meet all primordial abundance
constraints. In such models abundance constraints can be met even when the
pre-collapse baryonic fraction of the closure density is $\Omega_b\approx
0.2h^{-2}$($h$ is the Hubble parameter in units of 100 km\ s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$).
Nucleosynthesis in these models is characterized by high $^2$H/H and low $^4$He
mass fraction relative to a homogeneous big bang at a given value of
$\Omega_bh^2$. A potentially observable signature of these models is the
production of intrinsic primordial abundance variations on baryon mass-scales
up to $10^{10}M_{\odot}-10^{12}_{\odot}$.

  SPEC / 1994",,"10.1051/jp1:1995127",,"cond-mat",,"  We present a detailed study of simple `tree' models for off equilibrium
dynamics and aging in glassy systems. The simplest tree describes the landscape
of a random energy model, whereas multifurcating trees occur in the solution of
the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. An important ingredient taken from these
models is the exponential distribution of deep free-energies, which translate
into a power-law distribution of the residence time within metastable
`valleys'. These power law distributions have infinite mean in the spin-glass
phase and this leads to the aging phenomenon. To each level of the tree are
associated an overlap and the exponent of the time distribution. We solve these
models for a finite (but arbitrary) number of levels and show that a two level
tree accounts very well for many experimental observations (thermoremanent
magnetisation, a.c susceptibility, second noise spectrum....). We introduce the
idea that the deepest levels of the tree correspond to equilibrium dynamics
whereas the upper levels correspond to aging. Temperature cycling experiments
suggest that the borderline between the two is temperature dependent. The
spin-glass transition corresponds to the temperature at which the uppermost
level is put out of equilibrium but is subsequently followed by a sequence of
(dynamical) phase transitions corresponding to non equilibrium dynamics within
deeper and deeper levels. We tentatively try to relate this `tree' picture to
the real space `droplet' model, and speculate on how the final description of
spin-glasses might look like.
