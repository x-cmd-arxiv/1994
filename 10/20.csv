environmental stresses such as harsh climates and so are more easily rendered
extinct. Results of simulations and analytic calculations using our model show
a power-law distribution of extinction sizes which is in reasonable agreement
with fossil data. e also see a number of features qualitatively similar to
those seen in the fossil record. For example, we see frequent smaller
extinctions in the wake of a large mass extinction, which arise because there
is reduced competition for resources in the aftermath of a large extinction
event, so that species which would not normally be able to compete can get a
foothold, but only until the next cold winter or bad attack of the flu comes
along to wipe them out.

are characterized by an infinite set of independent anomalous exponents which
describes the scaling behavior of hydrodynamic fields constructed from the

responsible for anomalous scaling, ``telescopic multi-step eddy interaction"",
is discovered and investigated. The essence of this mechanism is the existence
of a very large number $(R/\eta)^{\Delta_j}\gg 1$ of channels of interaction of
large eddies of scale $R$ in the inertial interval with eddies of viscous scale
$\eta$ via a set of eddies of all intermediate scales between $R$ and $\eta$.
The description of this mechanism based on the NS equation in the quasi
Lagrangian representation is presented. In the diagrammatic expansion of the
correlation function of the energy dissipation field $K_ {\varepsilon
\varepsilon}(R)$, we have found an infinite series of logarithmically diverging
diagrams. Their summation leads to a renormalization of the normal
Kolmogorov-41 dimensions. For a description of the scaling of various
hydrodynamic fields an infinite set of primary fields $O_n$ with independent
scaling exponents $\Delta_n$ was introduced. We have proposed a symmetry
classification of the fields $O_n$ enabling one to predict relations between
scaling the behavior of different correlation functions.

successive applications of the {\it noncommuting} \sltwor\ and \ooneone\
