Despite their low effective temperatures ($kT_e \simless 300 \rom{eV}$), low
luminosity accreting neutron stars with magnetic fields $B \sim (0.7-7) \times
10^{12}$ G could emit a substantial fraction ($0.5 - 5\%$) of their total
luminosity in a moderately broadened ($E/\Delta E \sim 2-4$) cyclotron {\it

of the thermal emission from these stars will be in the extreme
ultraviolet/soft X-ray regime, which is subject to strong interstellar
absorption and would be difficult to distinguish from spectra of other types of
objects. In sharp contrast, the {\it nonthermal} cyclotron component predicted
here will not be strongly absorbed, and consequently it may be the only
distinguishing signature for the bulk of these low luminosity sources. We
propose a search for this cyclotron emission feature in long pointed

Gunn-Peterson effect at high redshift, a quantitatively testable and repeatable
procedure, in particular, a robust statistical weighting technique, is
developed. It is applied to an echelle spectrum of resolution 15 km s$^{-1}$ of
PKS 1937-101 with z=3.787. A weighted intensity distribution which is derived
overwhelmingly from pixels close to the continuum level in the Ly alpha forest
region is constructed by the evaluation of how closely correlated each pixel is
with its neighboring pixels. The merit of the distribution is its stronger and
narrower peak compared to the unweighted, as well as its smaller dependence on
uncertainty of strong absorption lines and noise spikes. By comparison to the
weighted intensity distribution of synthetic Ly alpha forest spectrum with
various chosen diffuse HI opacities, a chi square fit is performed. In addition
to a weak line population with power law N_H distribution $\beta =1.7$
extrapolated down to 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, a best chi square fit requires a GP
opacity of $0.115 \pm 0.025$ at average z=3.4 with estimation of the
contribution from the variance of $\beta$. Although no evidence of more than
1-2\% error is seen in the continuum extrapolation, the possible systematic
overestimation due to the slope can be as high as the level of the $\chi^2$
fit, which is investigated by splitting the \Lya forest region into subsamples
to check the continuum drop's dependence on absorber redshift.

emission component at $kT \sim 1$ keV. In addition, this state tends to have
very low variability which indicates that it is relatively stable, at least on
{\it short} time scales. Most models of the high state imply that the bulk of
the emission comes from an optically thick accretion disc; therefore, this
state may be an excellent laboratory for testing our ideas about the physics of
accretion discs. In this work we consider the implications of assuming that
accretion disc viscosity arises from some form of turbulence. Specifically, we
consider the simple case of three dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence. It is
found that the coupling of such turbulence to acoustic modes in the disc can
alter the disc emission. We calculate the amplitude and frequencies of this
modulation, and we express our results in terms of the X-ray power spectral
density. We compare our calculations with observations of the black hole
candidate GS 1124-683, and show that for certain parameters we can reproduce
some of the high frequency power. We then briefly explore mechanisms for
producing the low frequency power, and note the difficulty that a single
variability mechanism has in reproducing the full range of observed
variability. In addition, we outline ways in which future spacecraft missions
-- such as USA and XTE -- can further constrain our model, especially at
frequencies above $\sim 10^2$ Hz.

Ly$\alpha$ data only at $z<2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with data
at $z>3$. The predictions of CHDM are quite sensitive to the neutrino fraction.
We find that $\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b = 0.725/0.20/0.075$ is compatible

lowering the neutrino mass from 7.0 to 4.7 eV, for $H_0=50\kmsMpc$ and

by single partial representations (so-called U(nderspecified) D(iscourse)

monotonically to gain more information about the content of a sentence. There
is no need to build up a large number of alternative representations of the

application: 1) Noncritical strings are dissipative systems in the ""coupling

  But the quantum descriptions of the dissipative systems have well known
ambiguities. In order to solve the problems of the quantum description of
dissipative systems we suggest to introduce an operator W in addition to usual
(associative) operators. The suggested operator algebra does not violate
Heisenberg algebra because we extend the canonical commutation relations by
introducing an operator W of the nonholonomic quantities in addition to the
usual (associative) operators of usual (holonomic) coordinate -momentum
functions. To satisfy the generalized commutation relations the operator W must
be nonassociative nonLieble (does not satisfied the Jacobi identity) operator.
As the result of these properties the total time derivative of the
multiplication and commutator of the operators does not satisfies the Leibnitz
rule. This lead to compatibility of quantum equations of motion for dissipative
systems and canonical commutation relations. The suggested generalization of
the von Neumann equation is connected with classical Liouville equation for
dissipative systems.

meromorphic conformal field theories (CFT's), and, in particular, the
conditions under which such a CFT may be extended by a representation to form a
new theory. This general approach is illustrated by considering the untwisted
and $Z_2$-twisted theories, $H(\Lambda)$ and $\tilde H(\Lambda)$ respectively,
which may be constructed from a suitable even Euclidean lattice $\Lambda$.
Similarly, one may construct lattices $\Lambda_C$ and $\tilde\Lambda_C$ by
analogous constructions from a doubly-even binary code $C$. In the case when
$C$ is self-dual, the corresponding lattices are also. Similarly, $H(\Lambda)$
and $\tilde H(\Lambda)$ are self-dual if and only if $\Lambda$ is. We show that
$H(\Lambda_C)$ has a natural ``triality'' structure, which induces an
isomorphism $H(\tilde\Lambda_C)\equiv\tilde H(\Lambda_C)$ and also a triality
structure on $\tilde H(\tilde\Lambda_C)$. For $C$ the Golay code,
$\tilde\Lambda_C$ is the Leech lattice, and the triality on $\tilde
H(\tilde\Lambda_C)$ is the symmetry which extends the natural action of (an
extension of) Conway's group on this theory to the Monster, so setting triality
and Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman's construction of the natural Monster module
in a more general context. The results also serve to shed some light on the
classification of self-dual CFT's. We find that of the 48 theories $H(\Lambda)$

and further that all 9 coincidences are accounted for by the isomorphism

breaks down near the black hole horizon. On any hypersurface that captures both
infalling matter near the horizon and Hawking radiation, a semiclassical
