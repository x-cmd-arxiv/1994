CFHT MOS/SIS spectrograph, we have observed ~25 field galaxies with z > 1.
However, it is clear that almost an equal number, predominantly red galaxies,
have likely been missed largely because of limitations in the observed
wavelength range. The properties of the observed galaxies and the reasons for
the presumed incompleteness are briefly discussed in this contribution, and
strategies for improving our methods of observing high redshift galaxies are
explored. In particular, it is demonstrated that sky subtraction to the
required limiting magnitude is possible even with very low spectral resolution,
and that new IR arrays and new optical designs for multi-object spectrographs
will allow us to easily reach field galaxies at z > 1.

modulus is 24.3. A comparison with globular cluster sequences indicates that
the center of NGC147 is moderately metal-poor, with [Fe/H] ~ -1. This is not
significantly different from what was found in the outer regions of the galaxy
by Mould, Kristian & Da Costa (1983, ApJ, 270, 471). Moreover, the width of the
V-I color distribution at I = 21.0 indicates that a spread in metallicity is
present, with sigma[Fe/H] ~ +/- 0.3. There is no evidence of a component more
metal-poor than [Fe/H] ~ -1.3. A small population of moderately bright
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has also been detected, and the AGB-tip
occurs near M{bol} ~ -5.0, indicating that an intermediate-age population is
present. It is estimated that the intermediate-age population contributes ~
2-3% of the V light from NGC147.

extensions of the standard model, and may exist due to an instability in the

(quantum and classical). We then give an analytic treatment of quantum
mechanical reflection in the thin wall regime, in which interactions with the

leptons because of their much weaker coupling to the plasma. We argue that they
are likely to be accurately described by this calculation, but quarks are not.
The relative magnitude of the baryon asymmetry produced for different fermions
depends on their relative Yukawa couplings ({\it not} their zero temperature
masses), their transport properties and their interactions. We calculate the
baryon asymmetry for various parameter ranges and conclude that asymmetries
comparable with observations can be generated.

the presence of a CP violating condensate on the bubble walls, in the regime in
which the bubble walls are `thick', in the sense that fermions interact with
the plasma many times as the bubble wall passes. Such a condensate is present
in multi-Higgs extensions of the standard model and may be formed via an
instability in the minimal standard model. We concentrate on particles with
typical thermal energies in the plasma, whose interactions with the wall are
accurately described by the WKB approximation, in which a classical chiral
force is evident. The deviations from thermal equilibrium produced by motion of
the wall are then treated using a classical Boltzmann equation which we solve
in a fluid approximation. From the resulting equations we find two effects
important for baryogenesis: (i) a classical chiral force term due to the $CP$
violating background, and (ii) a term arising from hypercharge violating
interactions which are pushed out of equilibrium by the background{field.
Provided the wall propagates slower than the speed of sound, both terms lead to
the diffusion of a chiral asymmetry in front of the wall. This can produce a
baryon asymmetry of the observed magnitude for typical wall velocities and
thicknesses.
