that large amplitude perturbations will collapse, forming compact objects and
preventing their baryons from contributing to the observed baryon density. It
is found that baryon isocurvature perturbations are constrained to provide only
a slight increase in the density of baryons in the universe over the standard
homogeneous model. In particular it is found that models which rely on power

the three stratifications: of the umbra, the penumbra, and of the quiet sun,
all of them being treated as stellar like envelopes. Local differences between
the gas pressure in the neighbouring stratifications are balanced by the
magnetic forces confined to two current sheets: the magnetopause and the
peripatopause, whose shapes are determined by the solution of a free boundary
problem. A self consistent coupling between global magnetostatic and thermal

imperfect modeling of intra-sentential contextual influences. I argue that this
problem can be addressed by clustering the sentences in a training corpus
automatically into subcorpora on the criterion of entropy reduction, and
calculating separate language model parameters for each cluster. This kind of
clustering offers a way to represent important contextual effects and can
therefore significantly improve the performance of a model. It also offers a
reasonably automatic means to gather evidence on whether a more complex,
context-sensitive model using the same general kind of linguistic information
is likely to reward the effort that would be required to develop it: if
clustering improves the performance of a model, this proves the existence of
further context dependencies, not exploited by the unclustered model. As
evidence for these claims, I present results showing that clustering improves
some models but not others for the ATIS domain. These results are consistent
with other findings for such models, suggesting that the existence or otherwise
of an improvement brought about by clustering is indeed a good pointer to
whether it is worth developing further the unclustered model.

phase of $\lambda(\Phi^4)_4$ theory, as obtained from rigorous formal analyses
and from lattice calculations. All the existing evidence is compatible with
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking but dictates a trivially free shifted field that
becomes controlled by a quadratic hamiltonian in the continuum limit. As
recently pointed out, this implies that the simple one-loop effective potential
should become effectively exact. Moreover, the usual naive assumption that the
Higgs mass-squared $m^2_h$ is proportional to its ``renormalized''
self-coupling $\lambda_R$ is not valid outside perturbation theory: the
appropriate continuum limit has $m_h$ finite and vanishing $\lambda_R$. A Monte
Carlo lattice computation of the $\lambda(\Phi^4)_4$ effective potential, both
in the single-component and in the O(2)-symmetric cases, is shown to agree very
well with the one-loop prediction. Moreover, its perturbative leading-log
improvement (based on the concept of $\lambda_R$) fails to reproduce the Monte
Carlo data. These results, while supporting in a new fashion the peculiar
``triviality'' of the $\lambda(\Phi^4)_4$ theory, also imply that, outside
perturbation theory, the magnitude of the Higgs mass does not give a measure of
the observable interactions in the scalar sector of the standard model.

explicitly broken R-parity. (1) The resonant production of single squarks
through an operator $L_1Q_i{ \bar D}_j$. (2) The MSSM production of a squark
and a slepton followed by R-parity violating decays via the operators
$L_iQ_j{\bar D}_k$. The first case allows for a very large mass reach:
$m_{\tilde q}\leq 275\gev$ for moderate couplings. For masses $\sim 100\gev$
couplings down to $\lam\geq10^{-3}$ can be probed. In the second case the
production mechanism is independent of the R-parity violating Yukawa couplings.
The full generation structure and very low couplings, $10^{-6}$(!!), can be
probed. In the most optimistic case the mass reach is $170,195,205\gev$ for the
operators $L_{\tau,\mu,e}Q{\bar D}$ respectively. We conclude that HERA offers
a {\it very promising} discovery potential for \rpv\ SUSY.}}

functions in finite nuclei are studied in the quasi-elastic region. A method to
calculate the response function for a finite system composed of nucleon $(N)$
and $\Delta$ is formulated in a ring approximation. It is designed to treat the
$\Delta$-related Landau-Migdal parameters, $g'_{N\Delta}$ and
$g'_{\Delta\Delta}$, and the nucleon parameter $g'_{NN}$, independently, so
that the universality ansatz, $g'_{NN}=g'_{N\Delta}=g'_{\Delta\Delta}$, is
removed. We calculated the isovector spin-longitudinal and -transverse response
functions, $R_{L}$ and $R_{T}$, with and without the $\Delta$-mixing. Inclusion
of $\Delta$ enhances $R_{L}$ but reduces $R_{T}$ for ordinary interactions.
Dependence of $R_{L,T}$ on $g'_{NN}$ and $g'_{N\Delta}$ is investigated.
Decomposition into the process-decomposed response functions, $R^{[NN]}$,
$R^{[N\Delta]}$ and $R^{[\Delta\Delta]}$, is very elucidative to see the
$\Delta$ effects, which are found to be mainly governed by $R^{[N\Delta]}$ and
sensitive to $g'_{N\Delta}$. The isovector spin-transverse response function
$R^{(e,e')}_{T}$ obtained by $(e,e')$ is calculated by various effective
interactions and compared to each other as well as experimental data.
