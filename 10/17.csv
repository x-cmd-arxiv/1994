radiation (CBR) arising via the Sachs-Wolfe effect from gravitational wave
perturbations produced in the early universe. We consider spatially flat,
perturbed FRW models that begin with an inflationary phase, followed by a mixed
phase containing both radiation and dust. The scale factor during the mixed
phase takes the form $a(\eta)=c_1\eta^2+c_2\eta+c_3$, where $c_i$ are
constants. During the mixed phase the universe smoothly transforms from being
radiation to dust dominated. We find analytic expressions for the graviton mode
function during the mixed phase in terms of spheroidal wave functions. This
mode function is used to find an analytic expression for the multipole moments
$\langle a_l^2\rangle$ of the two-point angular correlation function
$C(\gamma)$ for the CBR anisotropy. The analytic expression for the multipole
moments is written in terms of two integrals, which are evaluated numerically.
The results are compared to multipoles calculated for models that are {\it
completely} dust dominated at last-scattering. We find that the multipoles
$\langle a_l^2\rangle$ of the CBR temperature perturbations for $l>10$ are
significantly larger for a universe that contains both radiation and dust at
last-scattering. We compare our results with recent, similar numerical work and
find good agreement. The spheroidal wave functions may have applications to
other problems of cosmological interest.

potentials may be easiliy obtained from it. As an example, we consider scalar

examine the influence of QG on dimensional transmutation and calculate QG
corrections to the scalar-to-vector mass ratio. The phase structure of the
RG-improved effective potential is also studied in this case, and the values of
the induced Newton and cosmological coupling constants at the critical point

electrodissociation of the deuteron at large $Q^{2}$ in a static external field
leads to the apparent reacceleration of neutrons. The shift of the neutron
velocity from the velocity of the deuteron beam is related to the
quantum-mechanical forward-backward asymmetry of the missing momentum
distribution in the $^2H(e,e'p)n$ scattering.

from elastic electron scattering data is investigated. The charge density
distributions are expanded on an orthonormal basis and the parameters of the
expansions are fixed by the comparison with the experimental data. Two bases
with different analytical properties (Fourier-Bessel and Hermite) are used.
This allows us to disentangle the uncertainties coming from the choice of the
expansion basis from those intrinsic to the extraction procedure. We design a
set of tests to select the number of the expansion coefficients adequate for a
proper description of the data. The procedure is applied to elastic data
measured on $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb nuclei.
