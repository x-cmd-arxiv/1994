relative equilibrium concentrations are determined by the local density. As the
star spins down, its centrifugal force decreases continuously, and the star
contracts. The density of any given fluid element increases, changing its
chemical equilibrium state. The relaxation towards the new equilibrium takes a
finite time, so the matter is not quite in chemical equilibrium, and energy is
stored that can be released by reactions. For a neutron star core composed of
neutrons (n), protons (p), and electrons (e), the departure from chemical
equilibrium is quantified by the chemical potential difference $\delta\mu\equiv
\mu_{\rm p}+\mu_{\rm e} -\mu_{\rm n}$. A finite $\delta\mu$ increases the
reaction rates and the neutrino emissivity. If large enough ($|\delta\mu|\gta
5kT$), it reduces the net cooling rate because some of the stored chemical
energy is converted into thermal energy, and can even lead to net heating. A
simple model shows the effect of this heating mechanism on the thermal
evolution of neutron stars. It is particularly noticeable for old, rapidly
spinning stars with weak magnetic fields. Observational consequences for
millisecond pulsars are discussed.

due to the conduction electron. Due to the existence of the Fermi surface there
exists Ohmic dissipation even at zero temperature, which is crucially different
from the case of the insulator. Taking into account the effect of pinning and
the external magnetic field the action is rewritten in terms of a collective
coordinate, the position of the wall, $Q$. The tunneling rate for $Q$ is
calculated by use of the instanton method. It is found that the reduction of
the tunneling rate due to the dissipation is very large for a thin domain wall
with thickness of a few times the lattice spacing, but is negligible for a
thick domain wall. Dissipation due to eddy current is shown to be negligible

  NORDITA 94/52P",,,,"hep-ph",,"  The stability of an abelian (Nielsen-Olesen) vortex embedded in the
electroweak theory against W production is investigated in a gauge defined by
the condition of a single-component Higgs field. The model is characterized by
the parameters $\beta=({M_H\over M_Z})^2$ and $\gamma=\cos^2\theta_{\rm w}$
where $\theta_{\rm w}$ is the weak mixing angle. It is shown that the equations
for W's in the background of the Nielsen-Olesen vortex have no solutions in the
linear approximation. A necessary condition for the nonlinear equations to have
a solution in the region of parameter space where the abelian vortex is
classically unstable is that the W's be produced in a state of angular momentum
$m$ such that $0>m>-2n$. The integer $n$ is defined by the phase of the Higgs
field, $\exp(in\varphi)$. Solutions for a set of values of the parameters
$\beta$ and $\gamma$ in this region were obtained numerically for the case
$-m=n=1$. The possibility of existence of a stationary state for $n=1$ with W's
in the state $m=-1$ was investigated. The boundary conditions for the
Euler-Lagrange equations required to make the energy finite cannot be satisfied
at $r=0$. For these values of $n$ and $m$ the possibility of a finite-energy
stationary state defined in terms of distributions is discussed.

interaction strength for which phase transition takes place, is seen to be
lower for deformed zero-coupled nucleon pair condensate with $\tau$ real,
supporting our earlier conclusion that the real deformation simulates the
two-body residual interaction. For $\tau$ purely imaginary a stronger pairing
interaction is required to bring about the phase transition. The effect of
imaginary deformation is akin to that of an antipairing type repulsive
interaction. Using deformed zero coupled quasi-particle pairs, a deformed
version of Quasi-boson approximation for $0^+$ states in superconducting nuclei
is developed. For the test model of 20 particles in two shells, the results of
q-deformed boson and quasi-boson approximations have been compared with exact
