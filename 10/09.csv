to one-photon radiative emission in the high-energy scattering of pions in the
Coulomb field of a nucleus with atomic number Z. It is shown that radiative
corrections can simulate a pion polarizability effect. The average effect was
estimated for pion energies 40-600 GeV. We also study the range of
applicability of the equivalent photon approximation in describing one-photon
radiative emission.
