curve and for any smooth point of $D_E$ we define a cotangent vector (a Higgs
field). The Hitchin map on these Higgs fields is then determined in terms of
the Gauss map on the divisor $D_E$. We apply the results to the $g=2$ case and
show how Hitchin's system is related to classical line geometry in $\PP^3$.

Telescope Wide Field Camera 2 (HST WFC2) images, we follow the detectability of
morphological signatures of disk galaxy mergers at intermediate redshifts z=0.4

use as an interaction signature limited; long tidal tails will only be
detectable relatively early in the encounter, before the galaxies actually
merge. Violent relaxation rapidly smooths isophotal irregularities after the
galaxies merge, leaving the very low surface brightness tidal debris
surrounding the remnant as the only sign of peculiarity after a few hundred
Myr. This debris becomes indistinguishable from the main body of the remnant
after 0.5 (z=1.0) to 1 (z=0.4) Gyr, leaving a morphologically normal elliptical
galaxy behind. Using WFC1, all signatures become undetectable almost
immediately once the galaxies merge, due to the aberrated PSF. We interpret
these results in light of recent HST programs investigating the nature of
starburst and E+A galaxies in moderate redshift clusters.

from the same locations on the sky provides a critical test of GRB models.
There is currently some controversy about whether there is evidence for burst
repetition in the BATSE data. We introduce a gamma ray burst ``pair matching""
statistic that can be used to search for a repeater signal in the BATSE data.
The pair matching statistic is built upon the reported position errors for each
burst and is more sensitive than previously used statistics at detecting faint
repeating bursts or multiple burst recurrences. It is also less likely to
produce (false) evidence of burst repetition due to correlations in the
positions that are inconsistent with repeating bursters. We find that the
excesses in ``matched"" and ``antipodal"" pairs seen with other statistics are
caused by an excess of pairs with a separation smaller than their error bars
would indicate. When we consider all separations consistent with the error
bars, no significant signal remains. We conclude that the publicly available
BATSE 1B and 2B data sets contain no evidence for repeating gamma ray bursters.

state of type-II superconductors. Our work is based on a previously developed
formalism which allows the mean-field gap equations of the Abrikosov state to
be conveniently solved in a Landau level representation. We find that the
quasiparticle band structure changes qualitatively when the pairing self-energy
becomes comparable to the Landau level separation. For small pairing self-
energies, Landau level mixing due to the superconducting order is weak and
magnetic oscillations survive in the superconducting state although they are
damped. We find that the width of the quasiparticle Landau levels in this
regime varies approximately as $\Delta_0 n_{\mu}^{-1/4}$ where $\Delta_0$ is
proportional to the magnitude of the order parameter and $n_{\mu}$ is the
Landau level index at the Fermi energy. For larger pairing self-energies, the
lowest energy quasiparticle bands occur in pairs which are nearly equally
spaced from each other and evolve with weakening magnetic field toward the
bound states of an isolated vortex core. These bands have a weak magnetic field
dependence and magnetic oscillations vanish rapidly in this regime. We discuss
recent observations of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in the mixed state of
several type II superconductors in light of our results.
