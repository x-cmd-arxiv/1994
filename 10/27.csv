$E$ on it will be called a {\sf generalized polarized variety}. The adjoint
bundle of the pair $(X,E)$ is the line bundle $K_X + det(E)$. We study the
positivity (the nefness or ampleness) of the adjoint bundle in the case $r :=
rank (E) = (n-2)$. If $r\geq (n-1)$ this was previously done in a series of
paper by Ye-Zhang, Fujita, Andreatta-Ballico-Wisniewski.
  If $K_X+detE$ is nef, then by the Kawamata-Shokurov base point free theorem,
it supports a contraction; i.e. a map $\pi :X \longrightarrow W$ from $X$ onto
a normal projective variety $W$ with connected fiber and such that $K_X +
det(E) = \pi^*H$, for some ample line bundle $H$ on $W$. We describe those
contractions for which $dimF \leq (r-1)$. We extend this result to the case in
which $X$ has log terminal singualarities. In particular this gives the Mukai's
conjecture1 for singular varieties. We consider also the case in which $dimF =

the generalized interacting winds model for planetary nebulae. First, a
detailed comparison between radiative and non-radiative models is made, showing
that one's naive expectations of the effects of radiative heating and cooling
are not always true. Secondly, we consider the evolution of the slow wind after
it has gotten ionized. It is found that the initial aspherical density
distribution is smoothed out after ionization, thus requiring the aspherical
nebula to be formed within the first few thousand years of PN evolution.
Thirdly, the nature of the flow in the hot bubble is investigated. Both one and
two-dimensional numerical models show strong signs of instabilities or
turbulent flow in the hot bubble. Although observationally hard to prove or
disprove this turbulent structure is critically examined. It is found that
although the turbulence is not a numerical artifact, the full three-dimensional
picture will most definitely differ from what is found in two dimensions. The
implications for the interpretation of the models are discussed. Finally, the
issue of the soft X-ray emission from PNe is considered. It is found that soft
X-rays originate mainly from the thin interface between the hot bubble and the
actual nebula.

when $L=4k+2$ the minimum energy $E$ occurs either for equal spacing or for
alternating spacings (dimerization); nothing more chaotic can occur. In
particular this statement is true for the Peierls-Hubbard Hamiltonian which is
the case of linear $t(w)$ and quadratic $V(w)$, i.e., $t(w)=t_0-\alpha w$ and
$V(w)=k(w-a)^2$, but our results hold for any choice of couplings or functions

asymptotically exact in the limit $L\to\infty$. Our analysis suggests three
interesting conjectures about how dimerization stabilizes for large systems. We

For polarised $\mu p$ scattering, the composite operator propagator is equated
to the square root of the first moment of the QCD topological susceptibility,
$\sqrt{\chi^\prime(0)}$. We evaluate $\chi^\prime(0)$ using QCD spectral sum
rules and find a significant suppression relative to its OZI expectation. This

singlet component of the first moment of $g_1^p$ is a target-independent
feature of QCD related to the $U(1)$ anomaly and is not a special property of
