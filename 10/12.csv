consistent with the expected contribution from evolving galaxies. Depending on
the behaviour of the star formation rate and of the initial mass function, we
can expect that dust extinction during early evolutionary phases ranges from
moderate to strong. An example of the latter case may be the ultraluminous
galaxy IRAS F$10214 + 4724$. The remarkable lack of high redshift galaxies in
faint optically selected samples may be indirect evidence that strong
extinction is common during early phases. Testable implications of different
scenarios are discussed; ISO can play a key role in this context. Estimates of
possible contributions of galaxies to the background under different
assumptions are presented. The COBE/FIRAS limits on deviations from a blackbody
spectrum at sub-mm wavelengths already set important constraints on the
evolution of the far-IR emission of galaxies and on the density of obscured
(``Type 2'') AGNs. A major progress in the field is expected at the completion
of the analysis of COBE/DIRBE data.

model for the integer quantum Hall effect is presented. The lattice regularized
model is cast in Hamiltonian form by taking the anisotropic limit and
interpreting the topological density as an alternating sum of Wess-Zumino
terms. It is argued that the relevant large-scale physics of the model is
preserved by projection of the quantum Hamiltonian on its sector of degenerate
strong-coupling ground states. For values of the Hall conductivity close to
e^2/2h (mod e^2/h), where a delocalization transition occurs, this yields the
Hamiltonian of a quantum superspin chain which is closely related to an
anisotropic version of the Chalker-Coddington model. The relation implies that
the ratio of magnetic length over potential correlation length is an irrelevant
parameter at the transition. The superspin chain resembles a 1d isotropic
antiferromagnet with spin 1/2. It has an alternating structure which however
permits an invariance under translation by one site. The conductance
coefficients of a quantum Hall system with N small contacts translate into
N-superspin correlation functions which are governed by conformal invariance.
The superspin formalism provides a framework for studying the crossover from
classical to quantum percolation. It does not however encompass the
frequency-dependent correlations of wave amplitudes at criticality.

applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned.

  geometric algorithms","38 pages",,,"LACES 68Q-94-24","math.CO cs.CC",,"  This paper describes a general-purpose programming technique, called the
Simulation of Simplicity, which can be used to cope with degenerate input data
for geometric algorithms. It relieves the programmer from the task to provide a
consistent treatment for every single special case that can occur. The programs
that use the technique tend to be considerably smaller and more robust than
those that do not use it. We believe that this technique will become a standard
tool in writing geometric software.

discussed. The general construction of ``binary'' Darboux transformations
preserving certain properties of the operator, such as self-adjointness, is
given. The classes of Darboux transformations found include the multicomponent
BKP and CKP reductions of the KP hierarchy.
