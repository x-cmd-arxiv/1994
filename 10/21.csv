techniques of algebraic geometry: closed positive currents, $L^2$ estimates for
the $\dbar$-operator on positive vector bundles, Nadel's vanishing theorem for
multiplier ideal sheaves (a generalization of the well-known Kawamata-Viehweg
vanishing theorem). Applications to adjoint line bundles are then discussed.
T.~Fujita conjectured in 1987 that $K_X+(n+2)L$ is very ample for every ample
line bundle $L$ on a non singular projective variety $X$ with $\dim X=n$. The
answer is known only for $n\le 2$ (I.~Reider, 1988). In the last years, various
bounds have been obtained for integers $m$ such that $2K_X+mL$ is very ample
(by J.~Koll\'ar, L.~Ein-R.~Lazarsfeld, Y.T.~Siu and the author, among others).
Two approaches are discussed: an analytic approach via Monge-Amp\`ere equations
and current theory, and a more algebraic one (due to Siu) via multiplier ideal
sheaves and Riemann-Roch. Finally, an effective version of the big Matsusaka
theorem is derived, in the form of an explicit bound for an integer $m$ such
that $mL$ is very ample, depending only on $L^n$ and $L^{n-1}\cdot K_X$; these
bounds improve Siu's results (1993), and essentially contain the optimal bounds
obtained by Fernandez del Busto for the surface case.

Careful analysis of pathlength limitations for the possible particle types due
to cosmic background radiation verifies that the particle very likely traveled
less than 50 Mpc from its source. The best candidates for accelerating
particles to such high energies are the very powerful radiogalaxies, however
they are all more than 100 Mpc distant. Our search finds no likely source
within 50 Mpc in the direction from which the particle arrived. This prompts
consideration of less likely astrophysical sources, like M82, as well as
non-standard mechanisms like cosmic string annihilation. It is also conceivable
that the air shower was produced by some non-standard particle whose pathlength
is unlimited because it does not interact with the cosmic background radiation.
A less radical alternative is that relatively strong magnetic fields deflected
the particle's path through a large angle, so it could have originated at a
nearby radiogalaxy at an earlier time of strong activity.

  potentials","17 pages, LaTeX","Astron.Astrophys.290:762-770,1994",,,"astro-ph chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  This paper proposes an alternative characterisation of the degree of
stochasticity exhibited by orbits in a fixed galactic potential. This differs
from earlier work involving Liapounov exponents by focusing on the statistical
properties of ensembles of trajectories, rather than individual orbits, and by
restricting attention to the properties of these ensembles over time scales
shorter than the age of the Universe, t_H. For many potentials, generic
ensembles of initial conditions corresponding to stochastic orbits exhibit a
rapid evolution towards an invariant measure $\Gamma$, the natural unit to
consider if one is interested in self-consistent equilibria. The basic idea is
to compute short time Liapounov exponents ${\chi}(Dt)$ over time intervals $Dt$
for orbits in an ensemble that samples $\Gamma$, and to analyse the overall
distribution of these ${\chi}$'s. One finds that time averages and ensemble
averages coincide, so that the form of the distribution of short time
${\chi}(Dt)$'s for such an ensemble is actually encoded in the calculation of
${\chi}(t)$ for a single orbit over long times $t>>t_{H}$. The distribution of
short time ${\chi}$'s is analysed as a function of the energy E of orbits in
the ensemble and the length of the short time sampling interval ${\D}t$. For
relatively high energies, the distribution is essentially Gaussian, the
dispersion decreasing with time as $t^{-p}$, with an exponent 0<p<1/2 that
depends on the energy E. (to appear in Astronomy and Astrophysics)

achieved with a minimal lexicon and a limited amount of {\em a priori}

reveals that there are three distinct patterns of Baum-Welch re-estimation. In
two of the patterns, the re-estimation ultimately reduces the accuracy of the

predicted from the quality of the initial model and the similarity between the
tagged training corpus (if any) and the corpus to be tagged. Heuristics for
deciding how to use re-estimation in an effective manner are given. The

of zero lepton masses the semi-leptonic decays $D \rightarrow K$ and $D

which are functions of $q^2$, where $q^{\mu}$ is the four-momentum transferred
in the process. Our results for these form factors at $q^2=0$ are:
$f^+_K(0)=0.67 \er{7}{8}$ , $V(0)=1.01 \err{30}{13}$ , $A_1(0)=0.70

includes gauge fixing, quantisation and regularisation. We emphasize the role
of cohomology of the antibracket operation. Our main example is $d=2$ gravity,
for which we also discuss the solutions for the cohomology in the space of
local integrals. This leads to the most general form for the action, for
anomalies and for background charges.

$R$-matrix with two deformation parameters$(p,q)$ is studied and, in
particular, its universal ${\cal R}$-matrix is derived using Reshetikhin's
method. Explicit construction of the $(p,q)$-dependent nonstandard $R$-matrix
is obtained through a coloured generalized boson realization of the universal
${\cal R}$-matrix of the standard $U_{p,q}(gl(2))$ corresponding to a
nongeneric case. General finite dimensional coloured representation of the
universal ${\cal R}$-matrix of $U_{p,q}(gl(2))$ is also derived. This
representation, in nongeneric cases, becomes a source for various
$(p,q)$-dependent nonstandard $R$-matrices. Superization of $U_{p,q}(\zeta ,
H,X_\pm )$ leads to the super-Hopf algebra $U_{p,q}(gl(1|1))$. A contraction
procedure then yields a $(p,q)$-deformed super-Heisenberg algebra
$U_{p,q}(sh(1))$ and its universal ${\cal R}$-matrix.

quasiclassical expansion for the Wilson loops and lines in this model. In a
particular parametrization this is a theory of two scalar massless fields
defined in the half-space $\{x\in \Z , \tau >0\} $. The extra dimension $\tau$
is related to the longitudinal mode of the strings. The topology-changing
string interactions are described by a local potential. The closed string
interaction is nonzero only at boundary $\tau =0$ while the open string
interaction falls exponentially with $\tau$.

representations of the split special orthogonal group $SO(2n+1)$ over a
nonarchimedean local field. If $n=1$, these models were considered by
Waldspurger. If $n=2$, they were considered by Novodvorsky and
Piatetski-Shapiro \cite{NP}, who called them {\it Bessel models}. They arise
from a variety of Rankin-Selberg integrals nad the resultos of this paper will
naturally have applications to the study of L-functions. They also arise in the
study of the theta correspondence between $SO(2n+1)$ and the double cover of
$Sp(2n)$, and they will therefore be of importance in generalizing the work of
Waldspurger. As a global application we consider the Eisenstein series on
$SO(2n+1)$ formed with a cuspidal automorphic representation $\pi$ on $GL(n)$,
and we show that its Bessel period (6.2) is essentially a product of L-series.
This generalizes work of B\""ocherer and Mizumoto.

used to investigate the importance of final state interactions [FSI] at large
momentum transfers in inclusive quasielastic electronuclear reactions. The
optical potential is derived from first-order multiple scattering theory and
then is used to calculate the FSI in a nonspectral Green's function doorway
approach. At intermediate momentum transfers excellent predictions of the
quasielastic $^{56}$Fe$(e,e')$ experimental data for the longitudinal response
function are obtained. In comparisons with recent measurements at $|{\vec
q|}=1.14$~GeV/c the theoretical calculations of $R_L$ give good agreement for
the quasielastic peak shape and amplitude, but place the position of the peak
at an energy transfer of about $40$~MeV higher than the data.
