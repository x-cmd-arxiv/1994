eigenvalue merges with the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis and
disappears. The evolution of the mode amplitude $\rho(t)$ is studied using an
expansion in $\rho$. As $\glim$, the expansion coefficients diverge, but these
singularities are absorbed by rescaling the amplitude:
$\rho(t)\equiv\gamma^2\,r(\gamma t)$. This renders the theory finite and also
indicates that the electric field exhibits trapping scaling $E\sim\gamma^2$.
These singularities and scalings are independent of the specific $F_0(v)$
considered. The asymptotic dynamics of $r(\tau)$ depends on $F_0$ only through

The ground state at small layer separations is a one-component triangular
lattice Wigner state. As the layer separation is increased, the ground state
first undergoes a transition to two stacked square lattices, and then undergoes
another transition at an even larger layer separation to a two-component
triangular lattice. The range of the layer separation at which the
two-component square lattice occurs as the ground state shrinks, and eventually
disappears, as the interlayer hopping is increased. An in-plane magnetic field
induces another phase transition from a commensurate to a incommensurate state,
similar to that of $\nu=1$ quantum Hall state observed recently. We calculate
the critical value of the in-plane field of the transition and find that the
anisotropy of the Wigner state, {\it i.e.,}, the relative orientation of the
crystal and the in-plane magnetic field, has a negligible effect on the
critical value for low filling fractions. The effect of this anisotropy on the

pseudo-Lorentz invariant particle pole as well as new spacelike cuts. Our
quantization shows that the spacelike cuts directly lead to a thermal vacuum

is responsible for < \psibarpsi > vanishing at high $T$. The thermal vacuum is
invariant under a new chiral charge, but continues to break the old zero

parameters that probe the physics of these spacelike cuts. In usual scenario,
the pion dissociates in the early alphabet soup. With this new understanding of
the thermal vacuum, the pion remains a Nambu-Goldstone particle at high $T$,

separated by a large distance $R$ is determined for high temperature QCD. It is
dominated by nonperturbative effects related to the exchange of magnetostatic
gluons. To analyze the asymptotic behavior, the problem is formulated in terms
of the effective field theory of QCD in 3 space dimensions. The Polyakov loop
operator is expanded in terms of local gauge-invariant operators constructed
out of the magnetostatic gauge field, with coefficients that can be calculated
using resummed perturbation theory. The asymptotic behavior of the correlator
is $\exp(-MR)/R$, where $M$ is the mass of the lowest-lying glueball in
$(2+1)$-dimensional QCD. This result implies that existing lattice calculations
of the Polyakov loop correlator at the highest temperatures available do not
probe the true asymptotic region in $R$.
