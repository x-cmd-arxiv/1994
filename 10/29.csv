issues related to the gravitational N-body problem, both Newtonianly and in the
context of general relativity. Topics addressed include: (1) direct N-body
simulations and their interpretation, with reference to the observed
exponential instability towards small changes in initial conditions and the
phenomenon of ``nonviolent relaxation;'' (2) the Hamiltonian structure of the
collisionless Boltzmann equation of general relativity, i.e., the
Vlasov-Einstein system; (3) ``transient ensemble dynamics,'' i.e.,,the short
time statistical characterisation of collections of orbits in nonintegrable
mean field potentials; and (4) the structural stability of the smooth potential
approximation typically used in galactic dynamics.

substructure on the statistics of the collapse of density peaks. Applying the
results of a former paper we show that within high density environments, like
rich clusters of galaxies, the collapse of smaller peaks is strongly delayed

because high density peaks preferentially collapse For a standard CDM model we
find that this dynamical bias can account for a substantial part of the total
bias required by observations on cluster scales.

others as the impact parameter $b$ decreases. We find the effective energy
density distribution generated by these collisions. The effective metric
generated by these collisions is a gravitational shock wave with profile
$f(\rho)\sim p\rho^{4-D}$, for large impact parameter $b$. For intermediate

only eliminates those gauge degrees of freedom which lie in the connected

proper physical symmetries arise either from gauge transformations that reach
to infinity or those that are asymptotically trivial but do not lie in the
connected component of transformations within that class. The latter
transformations form a discrete subgroup of all symmetries whose position in
the ambient group has proven to have interesting implications. We explain this
for the dyon configuration in the $SO(3)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, where we
prove that the asymptotic symmetry group is $Z_{|m|}\times \Re$ where $m$ is
the monopole number. We also discuss the application of the general setting to
general relativity and show that here the only implication of discrete
symmetries for the continuous part is a possible extension of the rotation

Minkowski universe, we derive a covariant quantum inequality-type bound on the
difference of the expectation values of the energy density in an arbitrary
quantum state and in the Casimir vacuum state. From this bound, it is shown
that the difference of expectation values also obeys AWEC and ANEC-type
integral conditions. In contrast, it is well-known that the stress tensor in
the Casimir vacuum state alone satisfies neither quantum inequalities nor
averaged energy conditions. Such difference inequalities represent limits on
the degree of energy condition violation that is allowed over and above any
violation due to negative energy densities in a background vacuum state. In our
simple two-dimensional model, they provide physically interesting examples of
new constraints on negative energy which hold even when the usual AWEC, ANEC,
and quantum inequality restrictions fail. In the limit when the size of the

and null geodesics which, in appropriate limits, reduce to AWEC and ANEC in
ordinary two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We also derive a quantum
inequality bound on the energy density seen by an inertial observer in

one--loop-${\cal O}(p^3)$ level in the chiral expansion and to leading order in
the heavy baryon expansion. Ultraviolet divergences occur requiring the
introduction of counter--terms. Despite this neccessity, no knowledge of the
counter terms is required to determine the violations to the Gell--Mann Okubo
mass relation for the baryon octet or to the decuplet equal mass--spacing rule,
as all divergences cancel {\it exactly} at this order. For the same reason all
reference to an arbitrary scale $\mu$ is absent. Neither of these features
continue to higher--powers in the chiral expansion. We also discuss critically
the absolute neccessity of simultaneously going beyond the leading order heavy
baryon expansion, if one goes beyond the one-loop-${\cal O}(p^3)$ level. We
point out that these corrections in $1/M_B$ generate new divergences $\propto
m^4/M_{10}$. These divergences together with the divergences occuring in
one-loop-${\cal O}(p^4)$ graphs of chiral perturbation theory are taken care of
by the same set of counter--terms. Because of these unknown counter--terms one
cannot predict the baryon mass splittings at the one-loop-${\cal O}(p^4)$
level. We point out another serious problem of going to the one-loop-${\cal
O}(p^4)$ level. When the decuplet is off its mass--shell there are additional
$\pi N\Delta$ and $\pi\Delta\Delta$ interaction terms. These interactions
contribute not only to the divergent terms $\propto (m^4/M_{10})$, but also to
nonanalytic terms such as $\propto (m^4/M_{10}){\rm ln}(m/M_{10})$. Thus
without a knowledge of the coupling constants appearing in these interactions
one cannot carry out a consistent one-loop-${\cal O}(p^4)$ level calculation.
