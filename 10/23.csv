black hole candidates. Over the last decade, much of the progress in this field
has been achieved through the study of transient X--ray binary sources which
shine only sporadically in the X--ray sky and undergo much larger luminosity
variations then most persistent sources. There are currently six stellar--mass
black hole candidates for which the mass of the compact object is estimated to
be well above the maximum neutron star mass. The three most recently identified
black hole candidates of this kind belong to a class of transient X--ray
sources with peculiar spectral properties. Several new transients of this class
are being discovered and studied every year thanks to more continous monitoring
of the X--ray sky. Many of them are likely to contain other black hole
candidates. The growing number of candidates and the large luminosity
variations (and therefore, accretion rate variations) in transient sources will
allow to study the chacteristics of accreting black holes with an unprecedented
detail.

D51 (1995) 3587-3592","10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3587",,"hep-ph",,"  In the heavy quark limit, hadrons appear as eigenstates of the light degrees
of freedom under the static color field of the heavy quark. In this formalism,
the weak form factors appear naturally as the overlaps of the initial and final
wavefunctions of the light degrees of freedom, and the Bjorken and Voloshin sum
rules are statements of conservation of probability and energy. Moreover,
parity conservation can lead to a sum rule which relates weak form factors at
different kinematic points. {}From this sum rule, model independent lower
bounds on Isgur--Wise form factors can be obtained analytically.

been investigated --- discrete quark-lepton symmetry. When this symmetry is
implemented, however, it often leads to either of the unrealistic predictions
$m_{u}=m_{e}$ or $m_{d}=m_{e}$. This paper considers two possible ways models
based on $m_{d}=m_{e}$ can be made realistic.

from 1 to 21 GeV^2. At issue is the presence of log corrections, which can be
absent if high x scattering has damped gluon radiation. We find logarithmic
correction of the scaling curve extrapolated to low Q^2 improves the duality
between it and the resonance plus background data in the Delta region,
indicating log corrections exist in the data. However, at W > 2 GeV and high x,
the data shows a (1-x)^3 form. Log corrections in one situation but not in
another can be reconciled by a W- or Q^2- dependent higher twist correction.
