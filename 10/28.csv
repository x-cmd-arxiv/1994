and 450 $\mu$m with the JCMT and derive flux densities of Sgr A* at all three
wave- lengths. Combined with upper limits by Gezari and associates at MIR
wavelengths a time averaged radio spectrum is obtained which increases $\propto
\nu^{1/3}$, attains a maximum at $\nu_max \ga 600 GHz$ and must decrease
rapidly at fre- quencies $\ga 10^4$GHz. This spectrum allows for about $3
M}_\odot$ of 50K dust and associated hydrogen in the telescope beam. While
variations on time-scales of a few months are now well established for the
frequency range $\nu \la 100 GHz$, our investigation of variability at higher
frequencies still yields only marginal results. The Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND)
extends over the central 12 pc. At the galactocentric radius $R \sim 1 pc$ dust
and hydrogen column densities drop to low values and form the Central Cavity.
Our submm images show that the bottom of this cavity is rather flat. Variations
in the dust emission are just consistent with the detection of a `Tongue' of
$\sim 200 M_\odot$ of atomic hydrogen reported by Jackson et al. (1993) to be
located between the Northern and the Eastern Arm of the Minispiral. We present
a revised submm/IR spectrum of the central $30\arcsec$ (R$\la 0.6 pc$) with
flux densities corrected for an interstellar extinction of $A_v \sim 31 mag$.
This spectrum attains its maximum at $\lambda \sim 20 \mu m$ and comes from
dust with temperatures $\sim 170 - 400 K$ which is associated with the Eastern
Arm and the East-West Bar. The in- tegrated luminosity is $\sim 5 10^6 L_\odot$
to which emission at $\lambda \la 30 \mu m$ contributes $\sim 80\%$. Heating of
this dust is not provided by a central source but rather by a cluster of hot
($T eff \sim 3 - 3.5 10^4 K$) and luminous stars which could include the He{\sc

dimensional de Sitter (dS) and anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, and analyze its
properties for the different (oscillating, contracting and expanding) strings.
The string equation of state has the perfect fluid form $P=(\gamma-1)E,$ with
the pressure and energy expressed closely and completely in terms of elliptic
functions, the instantaneous coefficient $\gamma$ depending on the elliptic
modulus. We semi-classically quantize the oscillating circular strings. The
string mass is $m=\sqrt{C}/(\pi H\alpha'),\;C$ being the Casimir operator,
$C=-L_{\mu\nu}L^{\mu\nu},$ of the $O(3,1)$-dS [$O(2,2)$-AdS] group, and $H$ is
the Hubble constant. We find $\alpha'm^2_{\mbox{dS}}\approx 5.9n,\;(n\in N_0),$
and a {\it finite} number of states $N_{\mbox{dS}}\approx 0.17/(H^2\alpha')$ in
de Sitter spacetime; $m^2_{\mbox{AdS}}\approx 4H^2n^2$ (large $n\in N_0$) and
$N_{\mbox{AdS}}=\infty$ in anti de Sitter spacetime. The level spacing grows
with $n$ in AdS spacetime, while is approximately constant (although larger
than in Minkowski spacetime) in dS spacetime. The massive states in dS
spacetime decay through tunnel effect and the semi-classical decay probability
is computed. The semi-classical quantization of {\it exact} (circular) strings
and the canonical quantization of generic string perturbations around the
string center of mass strongly agree.

traced back to the lack of a position operator $\hat{x}$, satisfying
$[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar\hat{1}$ with the ordinary momentum operator
$\hat{p}$, in the basic symmetry group -- the Poincar\'e group. In this paper
we provide a finite-dimensional extension of the Poincar\'e group containing
only one more (in 1+1D) generator $\hat{\pi}$, satisfying the commutation
relation $[\hat{k},\hat{\pi}]=i\hbar\hat{1}$ with the ordinary boost generator
$\hat{k}$. The unitary irreducible representations are calculated and the
carrier space proves to be the set of Shapiro's wave functions. The generalized
equations of motion constitute a simple example of exactly solvable
finite-difference set of equations associated with infinite-order polarization
equations.

regulator the combination of higher covariant derivatives and Pauli-Villars
determinants proposed by Faddeev and Slavnov. This regularization prescription
has the appealing feature that it is manifestly gauge invariant and essentially
four-dimensional. It happens however that the one-loop coefficient in the beta
function that it yields is not $-11/3,$ as it should be, but $-23/6.$ The
difference is due to unphysical logarithmic radiative corrections generated by
the Pauli-Villars determinants on which the regularization method is based.
This no-go result discards the prescription as a viable gauge invariant
regularization, thus solving a long-standing open question in the literature.
We also observe that the prescription can be modified so as to not generate
unphysical logarithmic corrections, but at the expense of losing manifest gauge
invariance.

intermetallic compounds NiSnM (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) and the closely related Heusler
compounds Ni$_2$SnM are discussed using the results of ab initio
pseudopotential total energy and band-structure calculations performed with a
plane wave basis set using the conjugate gradients algorithm. The results
characterize the lowest energy phase of NiSnM compounds, with a SnM rocksalt
structure sublattice, as narrow gap semiconductors with indirect gaps near 0.5
eV. Two other atomic arrangements for NiSnM in the MgAgAs structure result in
energetically unfavorable compounds that are metallic. The gap formation in the
lowest energy structure of NiSnZr and relative stability of the three atomic
arrangements are investigated within a tight-binding framework and by
considering the decompositions of each ternary compound into a binary
substructure plus a third element sublattice. The stabilization of the lowest
energy phase of NiSnZr is found to be mainly due to the relative stability of
the SnZr rocksalt substructure, while the opening of the gap induced by the
addition of the symmetry-breaking Ni sublattice makes a relatively minor
contribution. From analysis of structural and chemical trends, CoVSn is
predicted to be a new semiconducting intermetallic in the MgAgAs structure with
a 0.8 eV indirect gap.
