(AGN) is the origin of the FeII emission. FeI emission, if present, will help
reveal the physical conditions of the emitting gas. In an attempt to verify the
presence of FeI lines, high S/N spectra of two FeII-strong quasars, IRAS
07598-6508 and PHL 1092, were obtained at the Multiple Mirror Telescope and the
Steward 2.3 m Telescope. We have identified emission lines of FeI and TiII. The
source of energy for FeII, FeI and TiII emission is probably not from
ionization by the photon continuum, but heat. The high rate of energy
generation and the presence of both high and low velocity gas indicate that the
heat is generated not over a large area, but a narrow band in accretion disk,
in which the rotational speed decreases rapidly.

considered. They are statistically equivalent to a one-dimensional plasma of
particles interacting logarithmically and confined by the potential that has
the long-range behavior $V(\epsilon)\sim |\epsilon|^{\alpha}$ ($0<\alpha<1$),
or $V(\epsilon)\sim \ln^{2}|\epsilon|$. The direct Monte Carlo simulations on
the effective plasma model shows that the spacing distribution function (SDF)
in such RME can deviate from that of the classical Gaussian ensembles. For
power-law potentials, this deviation is seen only near the origin $\epsilon\sim
0$, while for the double-logarithmic potential the SDF shows the cross-over
from the Wigner-Dyson to Poisson behavior in the bulk of the spectrum.
