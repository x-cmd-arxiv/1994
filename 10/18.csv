early, radiation-dominated universe using an improved general relativistic
code. We find that in general a relativistic or nonrelativistic void collapses
via a shock at the speed of light. This is true even if the outward velocity of
the void wall is enormous. As the wall thickness decreases, the shock strength
increases and the collapse time decreases up to a limit set by the shock tube
solution. In addition, as the outward velocity of the wall increases, the
collapse time increases somewhat. When the collapse occurs in much less than a
Hubble time outside the void, gravitational forces contribute negligibly to the
solution at the collapse time; non-gravitational forces (caused by pressure and
velocity gradients) shape the solution almost entirely. This is true even if
the wall velocity is large enough that fluid in the peak shocks outward
substantially during this time. Gravitational forces are expected to be
dominant only {\it after} a void has collapsed.

of cross section. We expect this condition is generically satisfied if the
topology is unchanging for much longer than the light-crossing time of the
black hole. More precisely, let $M$ be a four dimensional asymptotically flat
spacetime satisfying the averaged null energy condition, and suppose that the
domain of outer communication $\C_K$ to the future of a cut $K$ of $\Sm$ is

consists of a disjoint union of 2-spheres, or $\S'$ is nonorientable and
$\partial\S'$ contains a projective plane. Further,
$\partial\S=\partial\Ip[K]\cap\partial\Im[\Sp]$, and $\partial \Sigma$ will be
a cross section of the horizon as long as no generator of $\partial\Ip[K]$

If a stable microscopic scale exists for some range of parameters, the model
should be in a translation invariant phase where SL(4) is spontaneously broken
to O(4). In that phase, SL(4) Ward identities imply that the correlation length
in the spin two channel of a symmetric tensor field is infinite. Consequently,
it may be possible to identify the continuum limit of four dimensional Quantum
Gravity with points inside that phase.

$\mbox{det}_{{ren}}$, in a static, unidirectional, inhomogeneous magnetic field
with finite flux can be calculated from the massive Euclidean Schwinger model's
determinant, $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$, in the same field by integrating
$\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$, over the fermion's mass. Since $\mbox{det}_{{ren}}$ for
general fields is central to QED, it is desirable to have nonperturbative
information on this determinant, even for the restricted magnetic fields
considered here. To this end we continue our study of the physically relevant
determinant $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$. It is shown that the contribution of the
massless Schwinger model to $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$ is cancelled by a contribution
from the massive sector of QED in 1 + 1 dimensions and that zero modes are
suppressed in $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$. We then calculate $\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$
analytically in the presence of a finite flux, cylindrical magnetic field. Its
behaviour for large flux and small fermion mass suggests that the zero-energy
bound states of the two-dimensional Pauli Hamiltonian are the controlling
factor in the growth of $\ln \mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$. Evidence is presented that
$\mbox{det}_{{Sch}}$ does not converge to the determinant of the massless
Schwinger model in the small mass limit for finite, nonzero flux magnetic
fields.

motion is stable, oscillatory in time with real frequencies $\omega_n=
\sqrt{n^2+m^2\alpha'^2H^2}$ and the string size and energy are bounded. The
string fluctuations around the center of mass are well behaved. We find the
mass formula which is also well behaved in all regimes. There is an {\it
infinite} number of states with arbitrarily high mass in AdS (in de Sitter (dS)
there is a {\it finite} number of states only). The critical dimension at which
the graviton appears is $D=25,$ as in de Sitter space. A cosmological constant
$\Lambda\neq 0$ (whatever its sign) introduces a {\it fine structure} effect
(splitting of levels) in the mass spectrum at all states beyond the graviton.
The high mass spectrum changes drastically with respect to flat Minkowski
spacetime. For $\Lambda<0,$ we find $<m^2>\sim \mid\Lambda\mid N^2,$ {\it
independent} of $\alpha',$ and the level spacing {\it grows} with the
eigenvalue of the number operator, $N.$ The density of states $\rho(m)$ grows
like $\mbox{Exp}[(m/\sqrt{\mid\Lambda\mid}\;)^{1/2}]$ (instead of
$\rho(m)\sim\mbox{Exp}[m\sqrt{\alpha'}]$ as in Minkowski space), thus {\it
discarding} the existence of a critical string temperature.
  For the sake of completeness, we also study the quantum strings in the black
string background, where strings behave, in many respects, as in the ordinary
black hole backgrounds. The mass spectrum is equal to the mass spectrum in flat
Minkowski space.

which determines whether or not a given sub-collection contains no bad objects.
The non-adaptive pooling (or group testing) problem involves identifying the
bad objects using the least number of tests applied in parallel. The
`hypergeometric' case occurs when an upper bound on the number of bad objects
is known {\em a priori}. Here, practical considerations lead us to impose the
additional requirement of {\em a posteriori} confirmation that the bound is
satisfied. A generalization of the problem in which occasional errors in the
test outcomes can occur is also considered. Optimal solutions to the general
problem are shown to be equivalent to maximum-size collections of subsets of a
finite set satisfying a union condition which generalizes that considered by
Erd\""os \etal \cite{erd}. Lower bounds on the number of tests required are
derived when the number of bad objects is believed to be either 1 or 2. Steiner
systems are shown to be optimal solutions in some cases.

corrections to a relativistic system of fermions in the presence of external
scalar and vector potentials. The method we propose allows to compute
efficiently semiclassical corrections to one body operators such as mean
energies and local densities. It also preserves gauge invariance and produces
explicitly convergent results despite some apparent divergencies at the
classical turning points. As a byproduct we obtain the $\hbar^4$ corrections
stemming from the polarization of the Dirac sea. We apply our results to the
relativistic $\sigma$-$\omega$ Lagrangian in the Hartree valence approximation.
We compare the semiclassical expansion with the exact result and with the
Strutinsky average whenever it can be obtained. We find that the $\hbar^4 $
corrections are much smaller than typical shell effects. Our results provide
convincing arguments to neglect higher than second order $\hbar$ effects in the
Wigner--Kirkwood scheme to relativistic nuclear physics in the mean field
approximation.
