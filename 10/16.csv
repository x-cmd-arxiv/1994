  Algebraic Surface","61 pages, amstex",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We study the behavior of the Gieseker space of semistable torsion-free
sheaves of rank r and fixed c_1, c_2 on a non-singular projective surface as
the polarization varies. It is shown that the ample cone admits a locally
finite chamber structure, and that passing a wall adjacent to a pair of
chambers has the effect of modifying the moduli space by a (finite) sequence of
flips of the type studied by Thaddeus. The key steps are a modification of
Simpson's method and the introduction of a ""rationally twisted"" moduli space.
The result is more general but less explicit than the recent work of
Ellingsrud-Goettsche (alg-geom/9410005) and Friedman-Qin (alg-geom/9410007).

separation process in bacterial photosynthesis using real-time path integrals.
Direct computer simulations as well as an approximate analytical theory have
been employed to map out the dynamics of the charge separation process in many
regions of the parameter space relevant to bacterial photosynthesis. Two
distinct parameter regions, one characteristic of sequential transfer and the
other characteristic of superexchange, have been found to yield charge
separation dynamics in agreement with experiments. Nonadiabatic theory provides
accurate rate estimates for low-lying and very high-lying bacteriochlorophyll
state energies, but it breaks down in between these two regimes.

systems containing carbon and hydrogen. The electronic degree of freedom is
treated explicitly in this potential using a small set of transferable
parameters which has been fitted to small hydrocarbons and radicals.
Transferability to other higher hydrocarbons were tested by comparison with ab
initio calculations and experimental data. The potential can correctly
reproduce changes in the electronic configuration as a function of the local
bonding geometry around each carbon atom. This type of potential is well suited
for computer simulations of covalently bonded systems in both gas-phase and
condensed-phase systems.

Lebesgue measure in infinite-dimensional spaces is not defined in general. The
problem lies in constructing representations of topological $^*$-algebras of
quantum fields which are not normed. We restrict our consideration only to
chronological forms on quantum field algebras. In this case, since
chronological forms of boson fields are symmetric, the algebra of quantum
fields can be replaced with the commutative tenzor algebra of the corresponding
infinite-dimensional nuclear space $\Phi$. This is the enveloping algebra of
the abelian Lie group of translations in $\Phi$. The generating functions of
unitary representations of this group play the role of Euclidean generating
functionals in algebraic QFT. They are the Fourier transforms of measures in
the dual $\Phi'$ to the space $\Phi$. By analogy with the case of boson fields,
the corresponding anticommutative algebra of fermion fields is defined to be
the algebra of functions taking their values into an infinite Grassman algebra.

the associated ghosts. The procedure of reconstructing the Kac--Moody currents
is closely related to properties of matter+gravity multiplets in noncritical
string theories. In application to KPZ gravity and its N=1 supersymmetric
extension, the `inverted hamiltonian reduction' constructions serve to
establish relation with the DDK-type formalism for matter + gravity.
