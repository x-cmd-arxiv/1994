$Aut(D)$ of all biholomorphic automorphisms of $D$ has a unique structure of a
real Lie group such that the action $Aut(D)\times D\to D$ is real analytic.
This structure is defined by the embedding $C_v\colon Aut(D)\hookrightarrow
D\times Gl_n(C)$, $f\mapsto (f(v), f_{*v})$, where $v\in D$ is arbitrary. Here
we restrict our attention to the class of domains $D$ defined by finitely many
polynomial inequalities. The appropriate category for studying automorphism of
such domains is the Nash category. Therefore we consider the subgroup
$Aut_a(D)\subset Aut(D)$ of all algebraic biholomorphic automorphisms which in
many cases coincides with $Aut(D)$. Assume that $n>1$ and $D$ has a boundary
point where the Levi form is non-degenerate. Our main result is theat the group
$Aut_a(D)$ carries a unique structure of an affine Nash group such that the
action $Aut_a(D)\times D\to D$ is Nash. This structure is defined by the
embedding $C_v\colon Aut_a(D)\hookrightarrow D\times Gl_n(C)$ and is
independent of the choice of $v\in D$.

source of ionizing radiation for the formation of baryonic structures is
investigated. Fully-ionized self-gravitating gaseous objects can be
radiation-pressure supported on a characteristic length scale $D_{\rm rp} \sim
100 \pc - 3 \kpc$. On smaller scales momentum transfer due to ionizing
radiation will be the dominant force and for spherical collapsing objects of
mass $\la 10^{10}\Msol$ a complete bounce is possible. A population of massive
stars and/or accretion onto a central compact object are natural sources of
ionizing radiation in newly-forming baryonic structures. Radiation pressure is
therefore likely to play an important role for the dynamical and thermal
evolution of the intergalactic medium and the mass-to-light ratio of small
galaxies. The effect will be especially important for hierarchical cosmogonies
where galactic structures build up by merging of smaller objects. Radiation
pressure due to ionizing radiation might furthermore be responsible for
substructures of size $D_{\rm rp}$ in the stellar component of large galaxies.

  Postscript file. (zhfl)",,"10.1086/176070",,"astro-ph",,"  The formalism of Wiener filtering is developed here for the purpose of
reconstructing the large scale structure of the universe from noisy, sparse and
incomplete data. The method is based on a linear minimum variance solution,
given data and an assumed \prior model which specifies the covariance matrix of
the field to be reconstructed. While earlier applications of the Wiener filter
have focused on estimation, namely suppressing the noise in the measured
quantities, we extend the method here to perform both prediction and dynamical
reconstruction. The Wiener filter is used to predict the values of unmeasured
quantities, such as the density field in un-sampled regions of space, or to
deconvolve blurred data. The method is developed, within the context of linear
gravitational instability theory, to perform dynamical reconstruction of one
field which is dynamically related to some other observed field. This is the
case, for example, in the reconstruction of the real space galaxy distribution
from its redshift distribution When the field to be reconstructed is a Gaussian
random field, such as the primordial perturbation field predicted by the
canonical model of cosmology, the Wiener filter can be pushed to its fullest
potential. In such a case the Wiener estimator coincides with the Bayesian
estimator designed to maximize the {\it posterior} probability. The Wiener
filter can be also derived by assuming a quadratic regularization function, in
analogy with the `Maximum Entropy' method. The mean field obtained by the
minimal variance solution can be supplemented with constrained realizations of
the Gaussian field to

reason for this is the existence of a second quadratic invariant, in addition
to energy. This implies the breakdown of the Kolmogorov type scaling law, in a
manner different from the conventional mechanisms proposed for Navier-Stokes
intermittency. By modifying the model equation so as to eliminate the spurious
invariant, we recover to good accuracy, both dynamic scaling and the Kolmogorov
exponents. We conclude that intermittency in the GOY model may be attributed to
the effects of the spurious invariant which does not exist in the 3-dimensional

quantum mechanics is presented. It is shown that for both Rubakov--Spiridonov
and Beckers--Debergh formulations of $(p=2)$-parasupersymmetric quantum
mechanics, the degeneracy structure of the energy spectrum can be derived using
the defining parasuperalgebras. Thus the results of the present article is
independent of the details of the Hamiltonian. In fact, they are valid for
arbitrary systems based on arbitrary dimensional coordinate manifolds. In
particular, the Rubakov--Spiridonov (R-S) and Beckers--Debergh (B-D) systems
possess identical degeneracy structures. For a subclass of R-S (alternatively
B-D) systems, a new topological invariant is introduced. This is a counterpart
of the Witten index of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

Under certain conditions it is shown that the noise-averaged Wigner function of
the system follows an integro-differential stochastic Liouville equation. In
the simple case of polynomial noise-couplings this equation reduces to a
generalized Fokker-Planck form. With nonlinear noise injection new ``quantum
diffusion'' terms arise that have no counterpart in the classical case. Two
special examples that are not of a Fokker-Planck form are discussed: the first
with a localized noise source and the other with a spatially modulated noise
source.

low energy effective action describing them. It is shown that the fermion pairs
behave like doubly charged spin-1 bosons and, when they condense, the gauge
field aquires the longitudinal mass. The approximate $SU(2)$ symmetry due to
the similarity between the fermion pairs and the gauge field is discussed.

"hep-th/9410188","Ivan Cherednik","Ivan Cherednik","Difference-elliptic operators and root systems",,,,,"hep-th math.QA",,"  Recently a new technique in the harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces was
suggested based on certain remarkable representations of affine and double
affine Hecke algebras in terms of Dunkl and Demazure operators instead of Lie
groups and Lie algebras. In the classic case it resulted (among other
applications) in a new theory of radial part of Laplace operators and their
deformations including a related concept of the Fourier transform.
  In the present paper we demonstrate that the new technique works well even in
the most general difference-elliptic case conjecturally corresponding to the
$q$-Kac-Moody algebras. We discuss here only the construction of the
generalized radial (zonal) Laplace operators and connect them with the
difference-elliptic Ruijsenaars operators generalizing in its turn the
Olshanetsky-Perelomov differential elliptic operators.

  Specifically, we prove that if $X_1,\dots ,X_n$ are solutions of an algebraic
matrix equation $X^n+A_1X^{n-1}+\dots +A_n=0,$ independent in the sense that
they determine the coefficients $A_1,\dots ,A_n$, then the trace of $A_1$ is
the sum of the traces of the $X_i$, and the determinant of $A_n$ is, up to a
sign, the product of the determinants of the $X_i$. We generalize this to
arbitrary rings with appropriate structures.
