plasma dynamics and transport phenomena. It affects both macroscopic plasma
behaviour and distribution of particles, and besides suprathermal component of
particle ensemble is even more sensitive to turbulent processes. We have
performed investigation of behaviour of fast particles in turbulent
inhomogeneous magnetized plasma. The general kinetic equation describing
evolution of fast particle distribution at the presence of MHD plasma
turbulence has been derived and analyzed. We constructed semi-analytical
solution of the kinetic equation into suprathermal energy region. Several
factors have been examined among them like turbulence else are nonuniform
external electric and magnetic field, and inhomogeneity of the plasma. It was
shown that last one is essential and may lead to some unexpected effects.

  Theorem","18 pages, LaTeX, version 2.09",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  In its most basic form, Dubreil's Theorem states that for an ideal $I$
defining a codimension $2$, arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay subscheme of
projective $n$-space, the number of generators of $I$ is bounded above by the
minimal degree of a minimal generator plus $1$. By introducing a new ideal $J$
which is the complete intersection of $n-1$ general linear forms, we are able
to extend Dubreil's Theorem to an ideal $I$ defining a locally Cohen--Macaulay
subscheme $V$ of any codimension. Our new bound involves the lengths of the
Koszul homologies of the cohomology modules of $V$, with respect to the ideal
$J$, and depends on a careful identification of the module $(I \cap J)/IJ$ in
terms of the maps in the free resolution of $J$. As a corollary to this
identification, we also give a new proof of a theorem of Serre which gives a
necessary and sufficient condition to have the equality $I \cap J = IJ$ in the
case where $I$ and $J$ define disjoint schemes in projective space.

production is related, in the helicity basis, to the imaginary part of the
product of two different distribution amplitudes, rather than to the usual
quark and gluon distribution functions; there is then no reason why it should
be zero even in massless perturbative QCD, provided the quark intrinsic motion
is taken into account. A simple model is constructed which reproduces the main
features of the data.

outcome of black hole formation. It is shown that the usual interpretation of
these rules violates the superposition principle and energy conservation.
Refinements of Hawking's rules are found which restore both the superposition
principle and energy conservation, but leave completely unaltered Hawking's
prediction of a thermal emission spectrum prior to the endpoint of black hole
evaporation. These new rules violate clustering. They further imply the
existence of superselection sectors, within each of which clustering is
restored and a unitary $S$-matrix is shown to exist. -- This is an expanded
version of a talk given at the Seventh Marcel Grossman Meeting on General
Relativity, Stanford CA.

of Stallings) iff every open set in the plane which contains the graph of f
contains the graph of a continuous function.
  Natkaniec showed that for any family F of continuum many real functions there
exists g:R->R such that f+g is almost continuous for every f in F. Let AA be
the smallest cardinality of a family F of real functions for which there is no
g:R->R with the property that f+g is almost continuous for every f in F. Thus
Natkaniec showed that AA is strictly greater than the continuum. He asked if
anything more could be said.
  We show that the cofinality of AA is greater than the continuum, c. Moreover,
we show that it is pretty much all that can be said about AA in ZFC, by showing
that AA can be equal to any regular cardinal between c^+ and 2^c (with 2^c
arbitrarily large). We also show that AA = AD where AD is defined similarly to
AA but for the class of Darboux functions. This solves another problem of
Maliszewski and Natkaniec.

electromagnetic fields are capable of producing copious numbers of lepton pairs
through the two-photon mechanism. Monte Carlo techniques have been developed
that allow the exact calculation of production by this mechanism when a
semi-classical approximation is made to the motion of the two ions. Here, we
develop a hybrid Monte Carlo technique that enables us to calculate the impact
parameter dependence of the two-photon mechanism for lepton-pair production,
and by using this result, we obtain the probability distribution for
multiple-pair production as a function of impact parameter. Computations are
performed for S$+$Au and Pb$+$Pb systems at 200 A GeV and 160 A GeV,

these dispersion relations we give (without a complete proof of sufficiency) a
characterization of scattering data for the potentials from the Schwartz class

potentials) we give a complete proof of this characterization. As a consequence
we construct a family (parameterized by a function of one variable) of
two-dimensional spherically-symmetric real potentials from the Schwartz class
$S$ transparent at a given energy. For the two-dimensional case (without
assumption that the potential is small) we show that there are no nonzero real
exponentially decreasing at infinity, potentials transparent at a fixed energy.
For any dimension greater or equal 1 we prove that there are no nonzero real
potentials with zero forward scattering amplitude at an energy interval. We
show that KdV-type equations in dimension 2+1 related with the scattering
problem $(*)$ (the Novikov-Veselov equations) do not preserve, in general,
these dispersion relations starting from the second one. As a corollary these
equations do not preserve, in general , the decay rate faster then $|x|^{-3}$
