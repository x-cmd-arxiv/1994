class have a coarse moduli space, which is a union of quasiprojective
varieties. In this paper, we prove that there are manifolds with ample
canonical class that lie on arbitrarily many irreducible components of the
moduli; moreover, for any finite abelian group $G$ there exist infinitely many
components $M$ of the moduli of varieties with ample canonical class such that
the generic automorphism group $G_M$ is equal to $G$. In order to construct the
examples, we use abelian covers, i.e. Galois cover whose Galois group is finite
and abelian. We prove two results about abelian covers: first, that if the
building data are sufficiently ample, then the natural deformations surject on
the Kuranishi family of $X$; second, that if the building data are sufficiently
ample and generic, then $Aut(X)=G$.

Comparison with previous data obtained in 1983 and 1987 shows that the broad

(2) the red and blue peaks varied at different epochs. The latter finding
strongly favors a predominance of radial motion. We argue that Pictor~A, and
the rare objects with similar extremely broad emission line profiles, are

elliptical galaxies is that the residual thermal energy of all supernovae

remaining interstellar gas, thereby driving a global galactic wind. We
re-examine model predictions of this epoch of wind ejection t_GW, highlighting
a heretofore underappreciated sensitivity to the adopted remnant thermal energy
formalism, and illustrating cases in which previous work may have substantially
overestimated t_GW. Arguments based upon chemical evolution alone, put forth to
reject the hypothesis of dark matter distributions similar to the luminous
component in spheroids, are shown to be tenuous. Finally, the predicted
enrichment of intracluster gas during the wind phase of cluster ellipticals,
and its relation to the selected SNR interior thermal energy evolutionary
scheme, is addressed. Despite the success of previous wind models, our results
still call into question the correctness of the simple analytical approach used
thus far, and imply that a more appropriate technique should be adopted in the

energy density contributed by the condensate, a characteristic proper time for
the system to exist prior to breakdown into a few pions, and a characteristic
extension of the system over the plane perpendicular to the collision axis.
These quantities then allow us to make definite estimates of new signals: a few
pions with anomalously small transverse momenta $\leq 50 $ MeV/c; and a
possible anomalous bremsstrahlung of very soft photons with characteristic
transverse momenta as low as about 4 MeV/c.

particles (mostly scalars and pseudoscalars) which originate from the hidden
sector of no scale supergravity theories. Using this we can restrict the
gravitino mass $m_{3/2}$. The range of eliminated values of $m_{3/2}$ stretches
over six orders of magnitude and is given by $\displaystyle{2 \times 10^8 <
{m_{\tilde g} \over m_{3/2}} < 6 \times 10^{13}}$, $m_{\tilde g}$ being the
gluino mass. Combining our result with the earlier analysis from colliders
($\displaystyle{ {m_{\tilde g} \over m_{3/2}} < 2.7 \times 10^{14}}$) we
conclude that $\displaystyle{{m_{\tilde g} \over m_{3/2}} < {\cal O}(10^8)}$
except for a narrow window around $10^{14}$. Together with the current
experimental limit on $m_{\tilde{g}}$ and cosmological constraints on
$m_{3/2}$, albeit model dependent, our analysis shows that a light gravitino is
on the verge of being ruled out.
