effect of gravity [1], Bertschinger and Hamilton derive equations for the
electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor for cold dust for both General
Relativity and Newtonian theory. Their conclusion is that both in General
Relativity and in Newtonian theory, in general the magnetic part of the Weyl
tensor does not vanish, implying that the Lagrangian evolution of the fluid is
not local. We show here that the `Newtonian' theory discussed by them is in
fact not Newtonian theory {\it per se}, but rather a plausible relativistic
generalisation of Newtonian theory. Newtonian cosmology itself is highly
non-local irrespective of the behaviour of the magnetic part of the Weyl
tensor; in this respect the Bertschinger-Hamilton generalisation is a better
theory.

which is generated by a primary spin-$s$ current in addition to the
energy-momentum tensor, and discuss the quantisation for $s\le8$. From these
examples we see that quantum BRST operators can exist even when there is no

that there can be several inequivalent ways of quantising a given classical

discuss their relation to certain minimal models. We also consider the
hierarchical embeddings of string theories proposed recently by Berkovits and

examine the whether classical BRST operators for $W_{2,{n\over 2}}$ ($n$ odd)
