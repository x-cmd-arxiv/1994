galaxies at the present epoch, ranging from late--type spiral galaxies to those
whose spectra and colors resemble present--day ellipticals. Contrary to some
faint field galaxy samples selected using different criteria, over the redshift

  OUTP-94-04A",,"10.1093/mnras/274.3.919",,"astro-ph",,"  A technique for the construction of axisymmetric distribution functions for
individual galaxies is presented. It starts from the observed surface bright-
ness distribution, which is deprojected to gain the axisymmetric luminosity
density, from which follows the stars' gravitational potential. After adding
dark mass components, such as a central black hole, the two-integral distribu-
tion function (2I-DF) f(E,Lz), which depends only on the classical integrals of
motion in an axisymmetric potential, is constructed using the Richardson- Lucy
algorithm. This algorithm proved to be very efficient in finding f(E,Lz)
provided the integral equation to be solved has been properly modified. Once
the 2I-\df\ is constructed, its kinematics can be computed and compared with
those observed. Many discrepancies may be remedied by altering the assumed
inclination angle, mass-to-light ratio, dark components, and odd part of the
2I-DF. Remaining discrepancies may indicate, that the distribution function
depends on the non-classical third integral, or is non-axisymmetric.
  The method has been applied to the nearby elliptical galaxy M32. A 2I-DF with
~55 degrees inclination and a central black hole (or other compact dark mass
inside ~1pc) of 1.6-2*10^6 Msun fits the high-spatial-resolution kinema- tic
data of van der Marel et al. remarkably well. 2I-DFs with a significantly less
or more massive central dark mass or with edge-on inclination can be ruled out
for M32. Predictions are made for HST-observations: spectroscopy using its
smallest square aperture of 0.09""*0.09"" should yield a non-gaussian central
velocity profile with broad wings, true and gaussian-fit velocity dispersion of
150-170km/s and 120-130km/s, respectively.

severely limits the alternatives which can be included in sets of histories
which assess the conservation of these quantities when they are not coupled to
a long-range field arising from a fundamental symmetry principle. We then
examine the realistic cases of electric charge coupled to the electromagnetic
field and mass coupled to spacetime curvature and show that when alternative
values of charge and mass decohere, they always decohere exactly and are
exactly conserved as a consequence of their couplings to long-range fields.
Further, while decohering histories that describe fluctuations in total charge

these do not, in fact, restrict {\it physical} alternatives and are therefore
not really limitations at all.

find no evidence of any transition at the location of a previously known bulk

at $ \beta_A = 1.1$ occurs at $\beta=1.20$ and is of first order for $\beta_A

question of quantifying the strength of the transition, and how `weak' and

available low temperature phases separated by an energy barrier so that one of
them becomes metastable below the critical temperature $T_c$. The system is
initially prepared in this phase and is coupled to a thermal bath.
Investigating the system at its critical temperature, we find that `strong'
transitions are characterized by the system remaining localized within its
initial phase, while `weak' transitions are characterized by considerable phase
mixing. Always at $T_c$, we argue that the two regimes are themselves separated
by a (second order) phase transition, with an order parameter given by the
fractional population difference between the two phases and a control parameter
given by the strength of the scalar field's quartic self-coupling constant. We
obtain a Ginzburg-like criterion to distinguish between `weak' and `strong'

"hep-ph/9410246","Nicholas J. Evans","Nick Evans","Dynamical Generation of the CKM Matrix","10 pages + 1 uuencoded and compressed figure, YCTP-P12-94",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We argue that in dynamical models of fermion masses, which explain the three
mass scales of the generations of fermions with three separate heavy scales
above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, the off diagonal CKM matrix
elements must be generated at a fourth scale. The simplest form for the
additional mass generation is a mechanism that has an $SU(3)_L \otimes SU(3)_R$
family symmetry. We show that such an ansatz can produce the up down mass
inversion and the observed Cabibbo angle. If the mass terms for the third
family quarks are enhanced by additional interactions the full CKM matrix may
be realized. We present a toy model which realizes vacua with these masses.}

the resummed mass, but also resummed non--local diagrams are of the same order,
thus altering the effective mass for small values of the latter.
