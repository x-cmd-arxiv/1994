  Invited review given at the `Asymmetrical Planetary Nebulae' conference,

reviewed. Since all of the numerical work is based on the interacting winds
model, we start with a description of this model and give an overview of the
early analytical and numerical models. Subsequently we address the numerical
models which include radiation effects, first of all the ones which neglect any
effects of stellar evolution. These `constant environment' models are shown to
closely match typical observed nebulae, both in images and kinematic data. This
shows that the basic generalized interacting winds model gives a good
description of the situation in aspherical PNe. Next we discuss models that do
include the effects of stellar and fast wind evolution. This introduces several
new effects, the most important of which are the formation of a surrounding
attached envelope, and the modification of the expansion of the nebula, which
helps in creating aspherical PNe very early on in their evolution. The
ionization of the slow wind also leads to a gradual smoothing out of its
aspherical character, working against aspherical PNe forming in later stages.
Finally we discuss some applications of the model to nebular problems.

\he3 is greatly over-produced and exceeds the inferred solar values and the

show a disturbing dispersion which is difficult to understand from the point of
view of standard chemical evolution models. In principle, resolution of the
problem may lie in either 1) the calculated \he3 production in low mass stars;
2) the observations of the \he3 abundance; or 3) an observational bias towards
regions of depleted \he3. Since \he3 observations in planetary nebula support
the calculated \he3 production in low mass stars, option (1) is unlikely. We
will argue for option (3) since the \he3 interstellar observations are indeed
made in regions dominated by massive stars in which \he3 is destroyed. In

fluctuations is introduced. It is an extension of Wegner's $n$-orbital model to
arbitrary eigenvalue distribution in the electronic level space. The new
feature is that the random energy values are not assumed to be independent at
different sites but free. Freeness of random variables is an analogue of the
concept of independence for non-commuting random operators. A possible
realization is the ensemble of at different lattice-sites randomly rotated
matrices. The one- and two-particle Green functions of the proposed hamiltonian
are calculated exactly. The eigenstates are extended and the conductivity is
nonvanishing everywhere inside the band. The long-range behaviour and the
zero-frequency limit of the two-particle Green function are universal with
respect to the eigenvalue distribution in the electronic level space. The
solutions solve the CPA-equation for the one- and two-particle Green function
of the corresponding Anderson model. Thus our (multi-site) model is a rigorous
mean field model for the (single-site) CPA. We show how the Llyod model is
included in our model and treat various kinds of noises.

lying in the neighbourhood of the unaccessible LEP 200 range. Remarkably
enough, for the present values of the top quark mass, the electroweak SUSY
effects could be, globally, very close or even bigger than the electroweak SM
corrections, but opposite in sign. Therefore, in the absence of theoretical
errors, there are large regions of parameter space where one could find that,
effectively, the electroweak SM corrections are ``missing'', or even having the
``wrong'' sign. This should be helpful in discriminating between the SM and the
MSSM. However, an accurate prediction of the electroweak quantum effects on

leave no room to the MSSM to solve the `R_b crisis' for any combination of the
parameters, not even admitting the possibility of a light chargino and a light
stop of O(50) GeV; however, for m_t not restricted by CDF, a `tangential'

above the phenomenological bounds, provided \tan\beta>m_t/m_b. Our general
conclusion is that, if there is a `R_b crisis' at all, its solution within the

strictly local, even off mass-shell, while the coefficient of the single-pole
term contains local as well as nonlocal parts. On mass-shell, the single-pole
part is local, of course. It is worth noting that the original overlapping

important feature of the matrix method is the ability to execute the

one needs boundary conditions. In a previous paper on $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory
we proposed to use the nine physical relevant couplings of the effective action
as boundary conditions at the physical point $\Lambda=0$ (these couplings are
defined at some non-vanishing subtraction point $\mu \ne 0$). In this paper we
show perturbatively that it is possible to appropriately fix these couplings in
such a way that the full set of Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identities are satisfied.
Three couplings are given by the vector and ghost wave function normalization
and the three vector coupling at the subtraction point; three of the remaining
six are vanishing (\eg the vector mass) and the others are expressed by
irrelevant vertices evaluated at the subtraction point. We follow the method
used by Becchi to prove ST identities in the RG framework. There the boundary
conditions are given at a non-physical point $\Lambda=\Lambda' \ne 0$, so that
one avoids the need of a non-vanishing subtraction point.

investigated. An exact factorizable S-matrix for the theory is proposed when
the renormalized coupling constant takes the values $\lambda^{2}_{R}=4\pi/k$
for any integer $k>1$: the minimal S-matrix associated with the Lie algebra
$a_{k-1}$. It is shown that the proposed S-matrix reproduces the leading
semiclassical behaviour of all amplitudes in the theory and is the minimal
S-matrix which is consistent with the semiclassical spectrum of the model. The
results are completely consistent with the description of the complex
sine-Gordon theory as the SU$(2)/{\rm U}(1)$ coset model at level $k$ perturbed
by its first thermal operator.

their approach to equilibrium and thereafter. These dynamics induce broadening
to the already unstable vector mesons which is calculated in the framework of
relativistic kinetic theory. A rather complete set of low-lying mesons provide
reaction partners whose interactions are modeled using effective Lagrangians.
Collision rates for $\rho$ and $\omega$ are found to be $\sim$ 100 MeV at
$T$=200 MeV while the rate for $\phi$ is $\sim$ 25 MeV. Corresponding mean free
paths are about 1 and 4 fm! Possible observable consequences are discussed.

We find that the changes in the hadron masses can be described in terms of the
value of the scalar mean-field in matter. The model is then used to calculate
the density dependence of the quark condensate in-medium, which turns out to be
well approximated by a linear function of the nuclear density. Some relations
among the hadron properties and the in-medium quark condensate are discussed.
