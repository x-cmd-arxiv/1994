postcollapse globular clusters having a power-law distribution of stellar
masses. We use a multi-mass Fokker-Planck code and assume a steady tidal field.
Stellar-dynamical processes cause the inner parts of the cluster to expand,
which in turn causes stars to overflow the tidal boundary. Mass loss by stellar
evolution is assumed to be unimportant in these later evolutionary stages. The
fraction of the cluster mass lost per half-mass relaxation time ($\trh$) is
roughly constant, in agreement with simple homologous models with equal-mass
stars. If $\trh$ is computed in the conventional way from the mean stellar
mass, however, a broad stellar mass function can double the loss of mass per
$\trh$. We discuss implications of our results for the evolution of
globular-cluster systems in our own and other galaxies. In particular, the
number of Galactic clusters destroyed by evaporation alone may be as large or
larger than the present cluster population.

the magnetoconductivity observed by Weiss et al.\ [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf70},

classical action of the periodic orbit. The amplitude is determined by the
stability and the velocity correlations of the orbit. The amplitude also
decreases exponentially with temperature on the scale of the inverse orbit
traversal time $\hbar/T_\gamma$. We also present a semiclassical derivation of
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations where the corresponding classical motion is

Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are closely related. However, the amplitude of
the quantum oscillations in antidot lattices is of a higher power in Planck's
