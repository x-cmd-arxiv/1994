field of the zeta Sculptoris cluster. We find that the cluster metal deficiency
previously found from UBV photometry is too high; the cluster overall
metallicity, [Fe/H]=+0.24, is about 70% higher than the solar value. The
chemical abundance pattern is unusual: the Ni/Fe ratio is significantly lower
than typical for field stars with similar Fe and Ca abundances, and the cluster
may also be deficient in the alpha element Si. For its age, the cluster is
unusually far from the galactic disk, approximately 240 pc. The adopted
heliocentric cluster radial velocity, +3.9 km/s, shows that it is close to its
maximum distance from the galactic plane. We suggest that the zeta Sculptoris
cluster was formed in the galactic disk 45 Myr ago by the interaction of a high
velocity cloud with the interstellar medium, and that its formation may be
connected with that of Gould's Belt. (Table3, postscript figures and text

transition from inflation to the hot Universe turns out to be strongly
model-dependent and typically consists of several stages. Immediately after
inflation the field $\phi$ begins rapidly rolling towards the minimum of its
effective potential. Contrary to some earlier expectations, particle production
during this stage does not lead to the appearance of an extra friction term
$\Gamma\dot\phi$ in the equation of motion of the field $\phi$. Reheating
becomes efficient only at the next stage, when the field $\phi$ rapidly
oscillates near the minimum of its effective potential. We have found that
typically in the beginning of this stage the classical inflaton field $\phi$
very rapidly (explosively) decays into $\phi$-particles or into other bosons
due to broad parametric resonance. This stage cannot be described by the
standard elementary approach to reheating based on perturbation theory. The
bosons produced at this stage, as well as some part of the classical field
$\phi$ which survives the stage of explosive reheating, should further decay
into other particles, which eventually become thermalized. The last stages of
decay can be described in terms of perturbation theory. Complete reheating is
possible only in those theories where a single massive $\phi$-particle can
decay into other particles. This imposes strong constraints on the structure of
inflationary models. On the other hand, this means that a scalar field can be a
cold dark matter candidate even if it is strongly coupled to other fields.

and perturbative calculability require that the effective potential has a
sliding gravitino mass and vanishing cosmological constant, up to ${\cal
O}(m_{3/2}^4)$ corrections. In particular, cancellation of quadratically
divergent contributions to the one-loop effective potential should take place,
including the `hidden sector' of the theory. We show that these conditions can
be met in the effective supergravities derived from four-dimensional
superstrings, with supersymmetry broken either at the string tree level via
compactification, or by non-perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation.
A crucial role is played by some approximate scaling symmetries, which are
remnants of discrete target-space dualities in the large moduli limit. We
derive explicit formulae for the soft breaking terms arising from this class of
`large hierarchy compatible' (LHC) supergravities.
