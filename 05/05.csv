disk coronae. The models are calculated using a new method for computing
monochromatic radiative transfer in two-dimensions. The method splits the
radiation into direct and scattered components. The direct radiation is
computed by calculating the optical depth along rays, while transfer of the
scattered radiation is approximated by flux-limited diffusion. The resulting
code agrees with more accurate treatments to within 50\%, and is highly
efficient, making it practical for use in large hydrodynamic simulations. The
coronal models are used to confirm the results of earlier work, and to extend
it to higher luminosities. In contrast to earlier work, which found the outer
disks to be shadowed by the inner corona at high luminosities, we find our
results to form an almost continuous extension of the models at lower
luminosities. This is due to the presence of multiply-scattered radiation,
which acts to partially offset the loss of direct radiation from the central
source. Although the analytic methods derived at lower luminosities cannot be
used to derive the coronal structure for $L/L\sr{Edd}\gapprox0.1$, the results
of the models are amenable to semiempirical fits. We also discuss possible
observational consequences of the results for coronal veiling and line
fluorescence from the disk.

by the condition that the scalar field is required to be real during a

literature within the FLRW framework, and also look at what happens when
physically motivated perturbations such as shear and bulk viscosity are
introduced. We find that in many cases, either the models are totally excluded

background (2+1 BH-ADS). We find the first and second order fluctuations around
the string center of mass and obtain the expression for the string mass. The
string motion is stable, all fluctuations oscillate with real frequencies and
are bounded, even at $r=0.$ We compare with the string motion in the ordinary
black hole anti de Sitter spacetime, and in the black string background, where
string instabilities develop and the fluctuations blow up at $r=0.$ We find the
exact general solution for the circular string motion in all these backgrounds,
it is given closely and completely in terms of elliptic functions. For the
non-rotating black hole backgrounds the circular strings have a maximal bounded
size $r_m,$ they contract and collapse into $r=0.$ No indefinitely growing
strings, neither multi-string solutions are present in these backgrounds. In
rotating spacetimes, both the 2+1 BH-ADS and the ordinary Kerr-ADS, the
presence of angular momentum prevents the string from collapsing into $r=0.$
The circular string motion is also completely solved in the black hole de
Sitter spacetime and in the black string background (dual of the 2+1 BH-ADS
spacetime), in which expanding unbounded strings and multi-string solutions
appear.

non-statistical interaction are discussed. Periodicity requirements of the
phase shifts are derived, and used to illustrate the danger inherent in
separating these phase shifts into the well-known pure Aharanov-Bohm phase
shifts, and an additional set which arise due to the interaction. It is proven
that the added phase shifts, although due to the non-statistical interaction,
necessarily change as the statistical parameter is varied, keeping the
interaction fixed. A hard-disk interaction provides a concrete illustration of
these general ideas. In the latter part of the paper, scattering with an
additional hard-disk interaction is studied in detail, with an eye towards
providing a criterion for the validity of the mean-field approximation for
anyons, which is the first step in virtually any treatment of this system. We
find, consistent with previous work, that the approximation is justified if the
statistical interaction is weak, and that it must be more weak for boson-based
than for fermion-based anyons.

the spatial geometry is the standard Riemannian geometry of a 3-manifold, and

applied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems. In particular,
there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are
analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for
handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review
the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss
many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a
few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape
invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have
the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape
invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar
potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering,
isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and
multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation
methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB
approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry
ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well
potential and for improving large $N$ expansions. We also discuss the problem
of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials
in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures
more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric
quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a
para-fermion of order $p$.

their initial trajectories. For the solitons of affine Toda field theories, the
space-time displacement of the trajectories is proportional to the logarithm of
a number $X$ depending only on the species of the colliding solitons and their
rapidity difference. $X$ is the factor arising in the normal ordering of the
product of the two vertex operators associated with the solitons. $X$ is shown
to take real values between $0$ and $1$. This means that, whenever the solitons
are distinguishable, so that transmission rather than reflection is the only
possible interpretation of the classical scattering process, the time delay is
negative and so an indication of attractive forces between the solitons.
