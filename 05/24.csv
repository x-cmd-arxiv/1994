is to be preferred to the Lagrangian one, on grounds of computational
simplicity, of ease of interfacing with observational data, and of internal

dynamical friction (DF) by a uniform background of light stars with isotropic
velocity distribution. In our scenario, the primary black hole $M_1$ sits, at
rest, in the center of the spherical star distribution (with mass $M_c$) and
the secondary less massive companion $M_2$ moves along bound orbits determined
by the background gravitational field; it loses energy $E$ and angular momentum
$J$ by DF. We investigate mostly analytically the secular evolution of the
orbital parameters when the motion of $M_2$ is determined either by the mean
field generated by the uniform stellar distribution or by the gravitational
field of $M_1$. We find that $J$ and $E$ are lost so as to cause the increase
of the eccentricity $e$ during the orbital decay of $M_2$. When $M_2$ enters
the region where the gravitational field of $M_1$ dominates, the evolution
depends on the ratio between the black hole velocity $v$ and the stellar
dispersion velocity $\sigma.$ We explore both cases $v<\sigma$ and $v>\sigma$.
Only for $v>\sigma$ the rise of $e$ would be severe but this transition occurs
close to the cusp radius below which our description becomes invalid. Energy
losses by gravitational wave emission become comparable to those by dynamical
friction at a critical distance that depends sensitively on the ratio
$M_1/M_c$. The braking index $n$ is calculated in this transition region.

at the \epm mode but unfortunately, the cross sections are dominated by the
transverse modes. Investigation of the physics related to the symmetry breaking
sector both in $W$ and $Z$ pair production is given and contrasted with what we

whether an intermediate-mass Higgs can be observed as a resonance when we have
a broad spectrum that allows the simultaneous study of a host of electroweak
phenomena. This investigation includes the important background of the

D51 (1995) 3267-3286","10.1103/PhysRevD.51.3267",,"hep-ph nucl-th",,"  We review the large-N_c approach to meson-baryon scattering, including recent
interesting developments. We then study pion-nucleon scattering in a particular
variant of the linear sigma-model, in which the couplings of the sigma and pi
mesons to the nucleon are echoed by couplings to the entire tower of I=J
baryons (including the Delta) as dictated by large-N_c group theory. We sum the
complete set of multi-loop meson-exchange
  \pi N --> \pi N and \pi N --> \sigma N Feynman diagrams, to leading order in
1/N_c. The key idea, reviewed in detail, is that large-N_c allows the
approximation of LOOP graphs by TREE graphs, so long as the loops contain at
least one baryon leg; trees, in turn, can be summed by solving classical
equations of motion. We exhibit the resulting partial-wave S-matrix and the
rich nucleon and Delta resonance spectrum of this simple model, comparing not
only to experiment but also to pion-nucleon scattering in the Skyrme model. The
moral is that much of the detailed structure of the meson-baryon S-matrix which
hitherto has been uncovered only with skyrmion methods, can also be described
by models with explicit baryon fields, thanks to the 1/N_c expansion.

for precision tests of QCD, e.g. measuring the strong coupling constant
alpha(s). A consistent analysis requires a good understanding of the
theoretical uncertainties and one of the most fundamental ones in QCD is due to
the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguity. Different methods, which have
been proposed to resolve the scale ambiguity, are applied to the 2+1 jet
cross-section and the uncertainty is estimated. It is shown that the
uncertainty can be made smaller by choosing the jet definition in a suitable
way.

together with a measurement of $Br(K_L\to \pi^\circ\nu\bar\nu)$ and the known
value of $\mid V_{us}\mid $ can determine {\it all} elements of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix without essentially any hadronic
uncertainties. In particular the strong dependence of $Br(K_L\to
\pi^\circ\nu\bar\nu)$ on $\mid V_{cb}\mid$ ($\mid V_{cb}\mid^4$) can be used to
determine this element precisely. Consequently $\mid V_{ub}\mid$, $\mid
V_{td}\mid$ and $\mid V_{ts} \mid $ can also be determined. We derive a set of
formulae which facilitate this study and we present a numerical analysis of
several future scenarios. Accurate determinations of all parameters are
expected from the B-factories and the Main Injector era at Fermilab including
KAMI. An impressive accuracy should be reached in the LHC era. An analysis
using $Br(\kpnn)$ instead of $Br(\klpnn)$ shows that although the determination
of $\mid V_{cb}\mid$ and $\mid V_{td}\mid$ this way is less accurate, still
useful results for these elements can be obtained.
