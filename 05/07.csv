a loud speaker shakes, is investigated numerically with the distinct element
method, a kind of molecular dynamics. When the bed is heavily shaken, the
displacement vectors of powder have the power spectrum with the dependence upon
the wave number $k$ as $k^{-5/3}$. The origin of this spectrum is suggested to
be the balance between the injected and dissipative energy, analogous to the
proposal by Kolmogorov to explain the $k^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum observed in
the fluid turbulence. Furthermore, the same spectrum still appears even without
flows of powder. Thus Kolmogorov's argument is more universal than believed
before.

the natural internal time coordinate for classical and quantum cosmology. The
reasons for this are a number of interesting properties of this functional,
which we describe here. 1)It is a function on the gauge and diffeomorphism
invariant configuration space, whose gradient is orthogonal to the two physical
degrees of freedom, in the metric defined by the Ashtekar formulation of
general relativity. 2)The imaginary part of the Chern-Simons form reduces in
the limit of small cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, and solutions close to
DeSitter spacetime, to the York extrinsic time coordinate. 3)Small matter-field
excitations of the Chern-Simons state satisfy, by virtue of the quantum
constraints, a functional Schroedinger equation in which the matter fields
evolve on a DeSitter background in the Chern-Simons time. We then n propose
this is the natural vacuum state of the theory for $\Lambda \neq 0$. 4)This
time coordinate is periodic on the configuration space of Euclideanized
spacetimes, due to the large gauge transformations, which means that physical
expectation values for all states in non-perturbative quantum gravity will
satisfy the $KMS$ condition, and may then be interpreted as thermal states.
5)Forms for the physical hamiltonians and inner product which support the
proposal are suggested, and a new action principle for general relativity, as a
geodesic principle on the connection superspace, is found.

theory, where a scalar field is coupled to gravity. Matter is modelled by a
$\gamma$-law perfect fluid, including false-vacuum energy as a special case.
Through a change of variables, we reduce the field equations from fourth order
to second order, and they become equivalent to a two-dimensional dynamical
system. We then analyze the entire solution space of this dynamical system, and
find that many qualitative features of these cosmologies can be gleaned,
including standard non-inflationary or extended inflationary expansion, but
also including bifurcations of stable or unstable expansion or contraction,
noninflationary vacuum-energy dominated models, and several varieties of
``coasting,"" ``bouncing,"" ``hesitating,"" and ``vacillating"" universes. It is
shown that inflationary dogma, which states that a universe with curvature and
dominated by inflationary matter will always approach a corresponding
flat-space solution at late times, does not hold in general for the
scalar-tensor theory, but rather that the occurence of inflation depends upon
the initial energy of the scalar field relative to the expansion rate. In the
case of flat space ($k=0$), the dynamical system formalism generates some
previously known exact power-law solutions.

  upon request",,,,"hep-ph hep-th",,"  I give an introduction to the theory of preasymptotic effects based on the
systematic OPE/HQET expansion in $1/m_Q$ where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass.
The general idea is explained in two most instructive examples, with an
emphasis on pedagogical aspects. Some important results of the last year are
reviewed. In discussing the issue of the quark-hadron duality, one of the basic
ingredients of the theory, I prove that the operator product expansion {\em per
se} is an asymptotic expansion. The behavior of the high order terms in this
expansion determines the onset of duality and the accuracy of the duality
relations. The factorial divergence of the high-order terms in OPE implies a
sophisticated analytical structure in the $\alpha_s$ plane, with terms of the
type $\exp [-\exp (1/\alpha_s )]$.
