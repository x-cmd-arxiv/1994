determine the likelihood of a given word combination. For example, a speech

the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training

infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method
for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations
using available information on ``most similar'' words. We describe a
probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity,
and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a
variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields a 20%
perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically

curves (CTC's) provides a tool for investigating how the creation of time
machines is prevented in classical general relativity. The Gott spacetime
contains two infinitely long, parallel cosmic strings, which can equivalently
be viewed as point masses in (2+1)-dimensional gravity. We examine the
possibility of building such a time machine in an open universe. Specifically,
we consider initial data specified on an edgeless, noncompact, spacelike
hypersurface, for which the total momentum is timelike (i.e., not the momentum
of a Gott spacetime). In contrast to the case of a closed universe (in which
Gott pairs, although not CTC's, can be produced from the decay of stationary
particles), we find that there is never enough energy for a Gott-like time
machine to evolve from the specified data; it is impossible to accelerate two
particles to sufficiently high velocity. Thus, the no-CTC theorems of Tipler
and Hawking are enforced in an open (2+1)-dimensional universe by a mechanism
different from that which operates in a closed universe. In proving our result,
we develop a simple method to understand the inequalities that restrict the
result of combining momenta in (2+1)-dimensional gravity.

dimensional black hole. We solve the equations numerically and obtain solutions
describing the entire the space-time geometry from the collapse to the end of
the evaporation. The solutions satisfy the evaporation law: $\dot M \propto
-M^{-2}$ which confirms dynamically that black holes do evaporate thermally. We
find that the evaporation process is in fact the shrinking of a throat that
connects a macroscopic interior ``universe"" to the asymptotically flat
exterior. It ends either by pinching off the throat leaving a closed universe
and a Minkowskian exterior or by freezing up when the throat's radius
approaches a Planck size. In either case the macroscopic inner universe is the
region where the information lost during the evaporation process is hidden.
