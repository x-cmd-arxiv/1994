  including figures. SISSA Ref. 56/94/A",,"10.1086/174702",,"astro-ph",,"  The least action principle (LAP) is a dynamically rigorous method for
deriving the history of galaxy orbits. In particular it is an Omega_0 test,
predicting current epoch galaxy velocities as a function of position and of the
cosmological background. It is most usefully applied to in--falling structures,
such as the local group, where its application indicates that the preferred
cosmological model is Omega_0 = 0.1 and h=0.75 (h is the Hubble parameter in
units of 100 Km s^-1 Mpc^-1). The method assumes that all the mass acts as if
it were distributed as the visible galaxies. We test the reliability of the LAP
to Local Group-like systems extracted from Omega_0=1 N--body simulations. While
the orbits of the galaxies are qualitatively well reconstructed, the LAP
systematically underestimates the mass of the system. This failure is
attributed to the presence of extended halos weakly clustered around visible
galaxies which prevent a large fraction of the group mass from being detected
by the LAP technique. We conclude that the LAP method cannot rule out an
Omega_0=1 value on the Local Group scale. Better constraints on Omega_0 may be
obtained by applying this technique to in--falling systems, such as clusters,
containing objects with separations large compared to galaxy sizes.

The scheme can simplify calculations with partial wave methods in the
atomic-sphere or muffin-tin approximation, since potential parameters can be
precalculated and then for a general system obtained through simple
interpolation formulas. We have applied the scheme to construct electron
potentials of phonons, surfaces, and different crystal structures of silicon
and aluminum atoms, and found excellent agreement with the self-consistent
effective potential. By using an approximate total electron density obtained
from a superposition of atom-based densities, the energy zero of the
corresponding effective potential can be found and the energy shifts in the
mean potential between inequivalent atoms can therefore be directly estimated.
This approach is shown to work well for surfaces and phonons of silicon.

all while the energy difference to the reference system can be obtained
approximately. We propose to calculate it using the tight-binding LMTO scheme

system that is relevant to the index theorem is analyzed in detail. The
Hamiltonian operator is shown to include a scalar curvature factor,
$\hbar^2R/8$. The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is then used
to obtain a formula for the index. For the first time, the path integral
