B334 (1994) 105-112","10.1016/0370-2693(94)90597-5",,"hep-th",,"  We consider ways in which conventional supersymmetry can be embedded in the
set of more general fermionic transformations proposed recently [\Ref{B}] as a
framework in which to study $d=10$ super Yang-Mills. Solutions are exhibited
which involve closed algebras of various numbers of supersymmetries together
with their invariance groups: nine supersymmetries with $\GT {\times}\SO (1,1)$
invariance; eight supersymmetries with $\SO (7){\times}\SO (1,1)$ invariance;
four supersymmetries with $\SO (3,1){\times}\U (3)$ invariance. We recover in
this manner all previously known ways of adding finite numbers of bosonic
auxiliary fields so as to partially close the $d=10$ superalgebra. A crucial
feature of these solutions is that the auxiliary fields transform non-trivially
under the residual Lorentz symmetry, even though they are originally introduced
as Lorentz scalars.

it may be possible to construct a time-dependent solution by just replacing the
moduli by some functions of time. We present several examples when such
`rolling moduli' ansatz is consistent. In particular, the anisotropic D=4
cosmological solution of Nappi and Witten can be reinterpreted as a
time-dependent generalisation of the (analytic continuation of) D=3 `charged
black string' background with the `charge' changing with time. We find some new
D=4 cosmological solutions which are `two rolling moduli' generalisations of
the previously known ones. We also comment on interplay between duality
transformations and the replacement of moduli by functions of time.

antikaons and antiprotons in heavy-ion collisions at subthreshold energies.
Using free-space widths for the $\Delta(1232)$ and the $N^{*}(1440)$ resonance
and free-space thresholds for particle production, it is found that the
$N^{*}$-baryon interactions contribute about 10\%, 25\% and 80\% to the yield
of kaon, antikaon and antiproton, respectively. Doubling the widths of
resonances due to possible medium effects, both the total and the $N^{*}$
induced antiproton yield decrease by about a factor of 3. Using a reduced
antiproton production threshold in a nuclear medium as a result of dropping
in-medium nucleon and antiproton masses, the total and the $N^{*}$ induced
antiproton yield increase by a factor of 35 and 27, respectively, and the
contribution of the $N^{*}$ induced collisions is reduced to about 50\% of the
total.

extracted for the $\alpha + ^{197}Au$ reaction at beam energies of 1 and 3.6

of intermediate mass fragments (IMF) at large correlation angles as a function
of the multiplicity of IMFs using a statistical model coupled with many-body
Coulomb trajectory calculations. The Coulomb component $\vec{v}_{c}$ and
thermal component $\vec{v}_{0}$ are found to depend oppositely on the
excitation energy, IMFs multiplicity, and freeze-out density. These
dependencies allow the determination of both the volume and the mean excitation
energy at the time of breakup. It is found that the volume remained constant as
the beam energy was increased, with a breakup density of about $\rho_{0}/7$,
but that the excitation energy increased $25\%$ to about 5.5 MeV/nucleon.

baryon resonances affects significantly the shape of kaon spectra, and the high
energy parts of the kaon spectra are dominated by kaons from $\pi N\rightarrow
\Lambda K^{+}$ processes. $N^{*}(1440)$ resonances are found to contribute
about 10\% to the kaon yield. Effects of boosting the Fermi momentum
distributions of the two colliding nuclei into their center of mass frame,
centrality of the reaction as well as the nuclear equation of state on kaon
yields and spectra are also discussed. Model calculations on $K^{+}$, $\pi^{+}$
