regions out of a Gaussian random field of initial cosmological perturbations.
The collapsing region is treated as an ellipsoid of constant density, acted
upon by the quadrupole tidal shear from the surrounding matter. The dynamics of
the ellipsoid is set by the ellipsoid self-gravity and the external quadrupole
shear. Both forces are linear in the coordinates and therefore maintain
homogeneity of the ellipsoid at all times. The amplitude of the external shear
is evolved into the non-linear regime in thin spherical shells that are allowed
to move only radially according to the mass interior to them. We describe how
the initial conditions can be drawn in the appropriate correlated way from a
random field of initial density perturbations. By considering many random
realizations of the initial conditions, we calculate the distribution of shapes
and angular momenta acquired by objects through the coupling of their
quadrupole moment to the tidal shear. The average value of the spin parameter,
0.04, is found to be only weakly dependent on the system mass, the mean
cosmological density, or the initial power spectrum of perturbations, in
agreement with N-body simulations. For the cold dark matter power spectrum,
most objects evolve from a quasi-spherical initial state to a pancake or
filament and then to complete virialization. Low-spin objects tend to be more
spherical. The evolution history of shapes is primarily induced by the external
shear and not by the initial triaxiality of the objects. The statistical
distribution of the triaxial shapes of collapsing regions can be used to test
cosmological models against galaxy surveys on large scales.

gravitational lensing of distant sources. Since no definite theoretical
predictions for the merging history of luminous galaxies exist, we adopt a
parametrized prescription, which allows us to adjust the expected number of
pieces comprising a typical present galaxy at z=0.65. The existence of global
parameter relations for elliptical galaxies and constraints on the evolution of
the phase space density in dissipationless mergers, allow us to limit the
possible evolution of galaxy lens properties under merging.
  We draw two lessons from implementing this lens evolution into statistical
lens calculations: (1) The total optical depth to multiple imaging (e.g. of
quasars) is quite insensitive to merging. (2) Merging leads to a smaller mean
separation of observed multiple images. Because merging does not reduce
drastically the expected lensing frequency it cannot make $\lambda$-dominated
cosmologies compatible with the existing lensing observations. A comparison
with the data from the HST Snapshot Survey shows that models with little or no
evolution of the lens population are statistically favored over strong merging
scenarios. The specific merging scenario proposed by Toomre (1977) can be
rejected (95\% level) by such a comparison. Some versions of the scenario
proposed by Broadhurst, Ellis \& Glazebrook (1992), are statistically
acceptable.

Gravitation theory meets spontaneous symmetry breaking in accordance with the
Equivalence Principle reformulated in the spirit of Klein-Chern geometries of
invariants. In gravitation theory, the structure group of the principal linear
frame bundle $LX$ over a world manifold $X^4$ is reducible to the connected
Lorentz group $SO(3,1)$. The physical underlying reason of this reduction is
Dirac fermion matter possessing only exact Lorentz symmetries. The associated
Higgs field is a tetrad gravitational field $h$ represented by a global section
of the quotient $\Si$ of $LX$ by $SO(3,1)$. The feature of gravity as a Higgs
field issues from the fact that, in the presence of different tetrad fields,
Dirac fermion fields are described by spinor bundles associated with different
reduced Lorentz subbundles of $LX$, and we have nonequivalent representations
of cotangent vectors to $X^4$ by Dirac's matrices. It follows that a fermion
field must be regarded only in a pair with a certain tetrad field. These pairs
fail to be represented by sections of any product bundle $S\times\Si$, but
sections of the composite spinor bundle $S\to\Si\to X^4$. They constitute the
so-called fermion-gravitation complex where values of tetrad gravitational
fields play the role of coordinate parameters, besides the familiar world
coordinates. In Part 1 of the article, geometry of the fermion-gravitation
complex is investigated. The goal is the total Dirac operator into which
components of a connection on $S\to\Si$ along tetrad coordinate directions make
contribution. The Part II will be devoted to dynamics of fermion-gravitation
complex. It is a constraint system to describe which we use the covariant
multisymplectic generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism when canonical
momenta correspond to derivatives of fields with respect to all world
coordinates, not only the time.

magnitude and kinematic dependence of the asymmetry. In contrast, the charm jet

  We find that the $^3P_0$ model is strongly favoured.
  In addition, we predict a $P/F$ amplitude ratio of $1.6\pm .2$ for the decay
$\pi_2\rightarrow\pi\rho$.
  We also study the parameter-dependence of some individual amplitudes (as
opposed to amplitude ratios), in an attempt to identify a ``best'' version of
the $^3P_0$ model.

terms of auxiliary gauge fields with zero curvature. Remarkably, the latter

thermal loops. This explains in particular why the generating functional could
have been obtained by Taylor and Wong from gauge invariance considerations. It
also clarifies the role of Chern-Simons theory in this context.

The main tool is a new notion of stable map. We give an outline of a

symplectic manifolds. Mirror Symmetry in the basic example of rational curves
on a quintic 3-folds is reduced to certain complicated but explicit identity.
The strategy of computations can be described as follows: 1) we reduce counting
problems to questions concerning Chern classes on spaces of curves on the
ambient projective space, 2) using Bott's residue formula we pass to the space
of (degenerate) curves invariant under the action of the group of diagonal
matrices, 3) we get a sum over trees and evaluate it using the technique of
Feynman diagrams. Our computation scheme gives ``closed'' formulas for
generating functions in topological sigma-model for a wide class of manifolds,
covering many Calabi-Yau and Fano varieties.
