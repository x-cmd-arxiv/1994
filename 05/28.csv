receptive inflectional morphology. The model takes inputs in the form of phones
one at a time and outputs the associated roots and inflections. Simulations
using artificial language stimuli demonstrate the capacity of the model to
learn suffixation, prefixation, infixation, circumfixation, mutation, template,
and deletion rules. Separate network modules responsible for syllables enable
to the network to learn simple reduplication rules as well. The model also
embodies constraints against association-line crossing.

among semantic roles in subordinate and main clause respectively. However if
there can be relations between every pair of semantic roles, the amount of
computation to identify the relations that hold in the given sentence is
extremely large. In this paper, for semantics of Japanese complex sentence, we
introduce new pragmatic roles called `observer' and `motivated' respectively to
bridge semantic roles of subordinate and those of main clauses. By these new
roles constraints on the relations among semantic/pragmatic roles are known to
be almost local within subordinate or main clause. In other words, as for the
semantics of the whole complex sentence, the only role we should deal with is a
motivated.

display snapshots of the evolution of the cylinder.

provides the seed for Majorana neutrino mass generation. Saturating the
cosmological bound of $50$ eV with $m_{\nu_\tau}$, we find that $m_{\nu_\mu}$

electron neutrino mass may vanish in the limit of degenerate charged Higgs
bosons. Unfortunately, $\nu_e - \nu_\tau$ mixing is also radiatively induced,
and is too small for sake of solving the solar neutrino problem via the

\to b \bar b$ will be one of the most important goals of a future photon linear
collider. Potentially important backgrounds from the continuum $\gamma\gamma
\to c \bar c, b \bar b$ leading-order processes can be suppressed by a factor
$m_q^2/s$ by using polarized photon beams in the $J_z=0$ initial-state
configuration. We show that the same $m_q^2/s$ suppressions do not necessarily
apply to the radiative processes $\gamma\gamma \to c \bar c g, b \bar b g$.
These processes can mimic the two-jet topology of the Higgs signal when two of
the three partons are collinear, or when one of the partons is soft or directed
down the beam pipe. We calculate the contribution of these processes to the
two-jet background in the $J_z=0$ channel. We investigate the effect of
imposing additional event shape, jet width and secondary vertex cuts on both
signal and background, and show that with reasonable detector capabilities it
should be possible to reduce the background to a manageable level.

falloff of these reactions can be described by lowest order (real) sum rules,
at moderate momentum transfer. The phases of these processes, in this regime,
are usually thought to be non-perturbative. In a sum rule framework, however,
they can possibly be described by radiative corrections to the hadronic
spectral densities of the corresponding helicities, which become complex
functions to order $\alpha_s$, and the effects of interference can be strongly
enhanced by the presence of the vacuum condensates in the dispersion relation.
It is shown that the imaginary parts of these complex corrections have a
factorized form and can be evaluated in a systematic fashion, while their real
parts, at the same perturbative order, are down by at least 2 powers of
momentum transfer. The analysis is done at two loop level, combining
dimensional regularization and light-cone methods. The calculations are
performed for all the independent set of scalar diagrams generated by the OPE.
The analytical bounds are identified and discussed.
