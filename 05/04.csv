reported Ginga and BATSE detections of absorption features in gamma ray burst
spectra. Currently no features have been detected by BATSE, but this
methodology will still be applicable if and when such features are discovered.
The Bayesian methodology permits the comparison of hypotheses regarding the two
detectors' observations, and makes explicit the subjective aspects of our
analysis (e.g., the quantification of our confidence in detector performance).
We also present non-Bayesian consistency statistics. Based on preliminary
calculations of line detectability we find that both the Bayesian and
non-Bayesian techniques show that the BATSE and Ginga observations are
consistent given our understanding of these detectors.

good probe of non--Gaussian behavior, in that $p(\bfv_1 - \bfv_2)$ tends to be
non--Gaussian whenever the density field is non--Gaussian. As an example, we
examine the behavior of $p(\bfv_1 - \bfv_2)$ for non--Gaussian seed models, in
which the density field is the convolution of a distribution of points with a
set of density profiles. We apply these results to the global texture model.

$D$, $E$ and elliptic $D$ models yield new solutions of the Yang-Baxter
equations with bond variables on the edges of faces in addition to the spin
variables on the corners. It is shown directly that the row transfer matrices
of the fused models satisfy special functional equations. Intertwiners between
the fused \ade models are constructed by fusing the cells that intertwine the
elementary face weights. As an example, we calculate explicitly the fused
$2\times 2$ face weights of the 3-state Potts model associated with the $D_4$
diagram as well as the fused intertwiner cells for the $A_5$--$D_4$
intertwiner. Remarkably, this $2\times 2$ fusion yields the face weights of
both the Ising model and 3-state CSOS models.

integral formalism. The energy-dependent Green functions for free particle plus
delta-function potential systems are explicitly calculated. Also the
energy-dependent Green function for the spin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm problem is
evaluated. It is found that the only one special value of the self-adjoint
extension parameter gives a well-defined and non-trivial time-dependent
propagator. This special value corresponds to the viewpoint of the spin-1/2
Aharonov-Bohm problem when the delta-function is treated as a limit of the
infinitesimal radius.

SW(3/2,3/2,2) by using the corresponding Toda-Field-Theories. In constructing
the series of minimal models using covariant vertex operators, we find a
necessary restriction on the Cartan matrix of the Super-Lie-Algebra, also for
the general case. Within this framework, this restriction claims that there be
a minimum of one non-vanishing element on the diagonal of the Cartan matrix,
which is without parallel in bosonic conformal field theory. As a consequence
only two series of SSLA's yield minimal models, namely Osp(2n|2n-1) and
Osp(2n|2n+1). Subsequently some general aspects of degenerate representations
of SW-algebras, notably the fusion rules, are investigated. As an application
we discuss minimal models of SW(3/2,2), which were constructed with independent
methods, in this framework. Covariant formulation is used throughout this
paper.

be accounted for by rescaling the cross section calculated within the plane

relativistic effects in the deuteron wave function is demonstrated by comparing
the predictions of different formalisms. Binding effects due to short range
