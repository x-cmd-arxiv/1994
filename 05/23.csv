Max-Planck-Institut f\""ur Mathematik, Bonn, (1989) MPI/89-28 (Russian), we had
extended the diagram method to algebraic surfaces with nef anticanonical class
(before, it was applied to Del Pezzo surfaces). The main problem here is that
Mori polyhedron may not be finite polyhedral in this case. In the \S 4 of this
preprint we had shown that this method does work for algebraic surfaces with
nef anticanonical class and log terminal singularities.
  Recently, using in particular these our results, Valery Alexeev (Boundedness
and K^2 for log surfaces, Preprint (1994), alg-geom/942007), obtained strong
and important results for surfaces of general type with semi-log canonical
singularities. The reason is that Del Pezzo surfaces (the diagram method is
especially effective for them) and surfaces of general type ""are connected""
through surfaces with numerically zero canonical class. This was the main
reason that we decided to make this English translation of the first part (\S
1--\S 3) of our preprint above with some extensions (where we give omitted
proofs) and minor corrections.
  This part contains basics of the diagram method for generalized reflection
groups in Lobachevsky spaces and for surfaces with nef anticanonical class.

constant $g_{\rm YM}\to 0$, and therefore the gauge field $A_\mu$ is
constrained to the pure-gauge configuration $A_\mu=g^{\dagger}\partial_\mu g$.
At zero temperature this model has been known to satisfy the confinement
condition of Kugo and Ojima which requires the absence of the massless

finite temperature case based on the real-time formalism, our model in 3+1
