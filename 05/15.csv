reduced directly, not using the normal forms, to the classification of
irreducible Weyl groups. We also prove that the class of a singularity in its
local algebra always belongs to the tangent cone to the stratum $\mu =const$ of
the singularity. An interesting characterization of Coxeter elements among
quasi-Coxeter elements of a Weyl group (of one of the types A-D-E) is found.

models where the inflaton potential is the sum of two exponential terms. A wide
range of spectra result, with the only constraint being that the scalar
spectrum must have more tilt than the tensor spectrum. This model can mimic the
spectra of most inflationary models, as well as producing combinations of
scalar and tensor perturbations not found in common varieties of slow-rolling
inflation.

  USP-IAG prep",,"10.1086/174811",,"astro-ph",,"  Short abstract: We present fully 3-D simulations of supersonic, radiatively
cooling intermittent jets with intermediate and long variability periods (that
is, periods of the order of or longer than, the dynamical time scale of the
jet). Variations of intermediate period elucidate the formation and evolution
of chains of internal regularly spaced radiative shocks, which in this work are
identified with the observed emission knots of protostellar jets. Variations of
long period elucidate the formation of multiple bow shock structures separated
by long trails of diffuse gas, which resemble those observed in systems like
HH111 and HH46/47. The time variability of the outflow is probably associated
with observed irruptive events in the accretion process around the protostars.
In our simulations, the outflow variations are produced by periodically turning
on the outflow with a highly supersonic velocity and periodically turning off
it to a low velocity regime. In the case of velocity variations of intermediate
period, we find, as in previous work, that the shock structures form a train of
regularly spaced emitting features which move away from the source with a
velocity close to that of the outflow, have high radial motions, and produce
low intensity spectra, as required by the observations. As they propagate
downstream, the shocks widen and dissipate due to the expulsion of material
sideways to the cocoon by the high pressure gradients of the postshock gas.
This fading explains the most frequent occurence of knots closer to the driving
source. In the case of the long period velocity variability, our simulations
have produced a pair of bow-shock-like structures separated by a trail almost

in the $S=1/2$ ``Haldane-Shastry'' model. Based on this rule we extend a recent
exact calculation \cite{H93} of the ground-state dynamical spin correlation
function $S^{ab}(n,t)$ = $\langle 0 | S^a(n,t)S^b(0,0)| 0 \rangle$ and its
Fourier-transform $S^{ab}(Q,E)$ of this model to a finite magnetic field. In
zero field, only {\it two-spinon} excitations contribute to the spectral
function; in the (positively) partially-spin-polarized case, there are two
types of elementary excitations: {\it spinons} ($\Delta S^z = \pm 1/2$) and
{\it magnons} ($\Delta S^z = -1 $). The magnons are divided into left- or
right-moving branches. The only classes of excited states contributing to the
spectral functions are: (I) two spinons, (II) two spinons + one magnon, (IIIa)
two spinons + two magnons (moving in opposite directions), (IIIb) one magnon.
The contributions to the various correlations are: $S^{-+}$: (I); $S^{zz}$:
(I)+(II); $S^{+-}$: (I)+(II)+(III). In the zero-field limit there are no
magnons, while in the fully-polarized case, there are no spinons. We discuss
the relation of the spectral functions to correlations of the
Calogero-Sutherland model at coupling $\lambda = 2$.

It is shown that the resonant spin--flavor precession of neutrinos due to the
interaction of their transitions magnetic moments with solar magnetic field can
account for all the available solar neutrino data. For not too small neutrino
mixing angles ($\sin 2\theta_0 \aprge 0.2$) the combined effect of the resonant
spin--flavor precession and neutrino oscillations can result in an observable
flux of solar $\bar{\nu}_{e}$'s.
