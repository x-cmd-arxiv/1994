cooperating for the common good. The choices they make are based on their
beliefs on how they expect their actions to affect others. We show that for a
broad set of beliefs and group characteristics cooperation can appear
spontaneously in non-cooperative groups after very long periods of time. When
delays in information are unavoidable the group dynamics acquires a wide
repertoire of behaviors, ranging from opportunistic oscillations to bursty
chaos, thus excluding the possibility of sustained cooperation.

appears in the contact terms of topological and antitopological operators. The
holomorphic anomaly, which can be interpreted as measuring the background
dependence, is obtained from the contact algebra relations.

Divergences are computed and renormalized at one-loop order. The mixing between
the Liouville field and the dilaton field eliminates $1/\epsilon$ singularity
in the Liouville-dilaton propagator. This smooth behavior of the dilaton
gravity theory in the $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ limit solves the oversubtraction
problem which afflicted the higher orders of the Einstein gravity in
$2+\epsilon$ dimensions. As a nontrivial fixed point, we find a dilaton gravity
action which can be transformed to a CGHS type action.

framework of the relativistic mean-field theory using the Generator Coordinate
Method (GCM). The constrained incompressibility and the excitation energy of
isoscalar giant monopole states are obtained for finite nuclei with various
sets of Lagrangian parameters. A comparison is made with the results of
nonrelativistic constrained Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculations and with those
from Skyrme RPA calculations. In the RMF theory the GCM calculations give a
transition density for the breathing mode, which resembles much that obtained
from the Skyrme HF+RPA approach and also that from the scaling mode of the GMR.
From the systematic study of the breathing-mode as a function of the
incompressibility in GCM, it is shown that the GCM succeeds in describing the
GMR energies in nuclei and that the empirical breathing-mode energies of heavy
nuclei can be reproduced by forces with an incompressibility close to $K = 300$
MeV in the RMF theory.
