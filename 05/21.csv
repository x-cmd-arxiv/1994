decay; d) Electroweak symmetry breaking. A combined fit of the free parameters
in the MSSM to these low energy constraints shows that the MSSM model can
satisfy these constraints simultaneously. From the fitted parameters the masses

that the axion is massive in any model in which the cosmological constant is
fine-tuned to zero through an explicit $R$-symmetry-breaking constant. In
visible-sector models, the axion mass is in the 100 MeV range and thus evades
astrophysical bounds. In nonrenormalizable hidden-sector models, the mass is of
order of the weak scale and can have dangerous cosmological consequences
similar to those already present from other fields. In renormalizable hidden-
sector models, the axion mass is generally quite large, of order $10^7$ GeV.
Typically, these axions are cosmologically safe. However, if the dominant decay
mode is to gravitinos, the potentially large gravitino abundance that arises
from axion decay after inflation might affect the successful predictions of
big-bang nucleosynthesis. We show that the upper bound on the reheat
temperature after standard inflation can be competitive with or stronger than
bounds from thermal gravitino production, depending on the model and the
gravitino mass.

with a slope parameter of $T \sim 15 \, \rm MeV$. We will present a scenario
which explains the observed slope parameter and which allows us to predict the
expected slope parameter for kaons produced in heavier systems such as Au+Au.
Implications for the restoration of chiral symmetry in relativistic heavy ion
collisions are discussed.(figures are being sent on request)

experiment on the Coulomb Dissociation of 8B uses E2 nuclear matrix elements
from one specific model. Other nuclear models predict a considerably smaller E2
cross section (by a pproximately a factor of 3 to 4), and Langanke and Shoppa
appear to assume the most optimistic scenario predicting large E2 cross
section. We also note that Barker has already criticised the nuclear model used
by Langanke and Shoppa. A MODEL INDEPENDENT Chi-Square analysis of the Riken
data, suggest the best fit for the current Riken data is obtained with E1
amplitudes only. The upper limit (90% confidence) on the E2 component derived
from our Chi-Square analysis is considerably smaller than used by Langanke and
Shoppa. The MODEL DEPENDENT analysis of Langanke-Shoppa should not be
considered as a correction to the Riken result, as claimed, and their quoted
S17(0) is not substantiated.
