merging disk galaxies. The properties of the merger-driven starbursts are
sensitive to the structure of the progenitor galaxies; specifically, to the
amount of material in a dense central bulge. Galaxies without bulges develop
bars shortly after their first close passage, driving significant gas inflow
and subsequent starbursts in the centers of the galaxies. These starbursts
significantly deplete the star-forming gas, so that only relatively weak
starbursts arise during the final merger. By contrast, models of galaxies with
central bulges show that a bulge acts to stabilize the galaxies against inflow
and starbursts until the galaxies actually merge. At this time, strong
dissipation leads to the formation of a massive central gas mass and an ensuing
star formation rate two orders of magnitude greater than that in our isolated
disk models. These starbursts are very short in duration, typically $\sim$ 50
Myr, suggesting that the rarity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies is a result
of their being in a very short evolutionary phase, rather than special and rare
formation conditions. The fact that these mergers display many of the
properties of ultraluminous infrared galaxies -- tidal features, double nuclei,
massive compact gas concentrations, and extreme levels of starburst activity --
suggests that merger-driven starbursts can explain the emission from many
ultraluminous infrared galaxies without an active nucleus.

clusters vary over three orders of magnitude as a function of cluster size. In
particular, they found that \Si{33}, \Si{39}, and \Si{45} clusters are least
reactive towards various reagents compared to their immediate neighbors in
size. We explain these observations based on our stuffed fullerene model. This
structural model consists of bulk-like core of five atoms surrounded by
fullerene-like surface. Reconstruction of the ideal fullerene geometry gives
rise to four-fold coordinated crown atoms and $\pi$-bonded dimer pairs. This
model yields unique structures for \Si{33}, \Si{39}, and \Si{45} clusters
without any dangling bonds and thus explains their lowest reactivity towards
chemisorption of closed shell reagents. This model is also consistent with the
experimental finding of Jarrold and Constant that silicon clusters undergo a
transition from prolate to spherical shapes at \Si{27}. We justify our model
based on an in depth analysis of the differences between carbon and silicon
chemistry and bonding characteristics. Using our model, we further explain why
dissociative chemisorption occurs on bulk surfaces while molecular
chemisorption occurs on cluster surfaces. We also explain reagent specific
chemisorption reactivities observed experimentally based on the electronic
structures of the reagents. Finally, experiments on \Si{x}X$_y$ (X = B, Al, Ga,
P, As, AlP, GaAs) are suggested as a means of verifying the proposed model. We
predict that \Si{x}(AlP)$_y$ and \Si{x}(GaAs)$_y$ $(x = 25, 31, 37; y = 4)$

samples of these alloy clusters through high temperature reactions.

the field configurations are restricted to satisfy a type of mod-$p$ flatness
condition. By explicit computation of the partition function for the manifold
$RP^{3} \times S^{1}$, we establish that the theory has a quantum Hilbert space
which differs from the classical one.

differential associated with the stationary surface. The cohomological group
$H_1(\delta |d)$ in form degree $n$ is proved to be isomorphic to the space of
constants of the motion, thereby providing a cohomological reformulation of
Noether theorem. More generally, the group $H_k(\delta|d)$ in form degree $n$
is isomorphic to the space of $n-k$ forms that are closed when the equations of
motion hold. The groups $H_k(\delta|d)$ $(k>2)$ are shown to vanish for
standard irreducible gauge theories. The group $H_2(\delta|d)$ is then

that the condition $\partial_i A_i$$=0$ is the most convenient one because it
leads to path integral over physical components with local action. However,
other choices, as $A_3=0$, are also possible. The standard expression for
configuration space path integral in $A_3=0$ gauge is obtained starting with
reduced phase space formulation. Contrary to the claims of the paper [M.Lavelle

gathered at the Bevalac, for Au+Au at $p=1-2$ GeV/c. In contrast to the
standard lore about the cascade model, collective flow is well described
quantitatively without the need for explicit mean field terms to simulate the
nuclear equation of state. Pion collective flow is in the opposite direction to
nucleon flow as is that of anti-nucleons and other produced particles. Pion and
nucleon flow are predicted at AGS energies also, where, in light of the higher
baryon densities achieved, we speculate that equation of state effects may be
observable.
