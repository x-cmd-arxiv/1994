  including figures. Milano Preprint # tbd",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss the effects of redshift--space distortions on the estimate of high
order galaxy correlation functions. We use both the Perseus--Pisces redshift
survey and the results of high--resolution N--body simulations to explore the
consequences of working in redshift space on the detection of deviations from
hierarchical clustering. Both for real and simulated data, significant
deviations from hierarchical clustering seem to be present in real space. Their
behaviour is coherent with that expected from an initially biased galaxy field,
once the displacement from the sites where galaxies formed, due to the
nonlinear gravitational evolution, is taken into account. The passage to
redshift space has the net effect of filtering out the higher powers required
to fit the distribution in real space. This magnifies the distortions operated
by nonlinear evolution on the initial distribution, erasing the residual narrow
scale range (2--5~$h^{-1}$Mpc) where deviations from hierarchical clustering
are still detectable in real space. We conclude that such deviations can hardly
be estimated using data in redshift space.

at cosmological distances are expected to deviate from their true positions by
a few arcminutes. These deflections are not directly observable. The positions
of the images relative to one another fluctuate by a few percent of the
relative separation, implying that one does not expect multiple images to be
produced by large scale structures. Nevertheless, the fluctuations are larger
than the observational errors on the positions and affect reconstructions of
the lens potential. The time delay fluctuations have a geometrical and a
gravitational contribution. Both are much larger than the expected time delay
from the primary lens, but partially cancel each other. We find that large
scale structure weakly affects the time delay and time delay measurements can
be used as a probe of the distance scale in the universe.

best fit of any model to all the available data at the current epoch, CHDM
produces structure at relatively low redshifts and thus could be ruled out if
there were evidence for formation of massive objects at high redshifts. Damped
Ly$\alpha$ systems are abundant in quasar absorption spectra and thus provide
possibly the most significant evidence for early structure formation, and thus
perhaps the most stringent constraint on CHDM. Using the numbers of halos in
N-body simulations to normalize Press-Schechter estimates of the number
densities of protogalaxies as a function of redshift, we find that CHDM with
$\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b = 0.6/0.3/0.1$ is compatible with the damped
Ly$\alpha$ data at $\le 2.5$, but that it is probably incompatible with the
limited $z>3$ damped Ly$\alpha$ data. The situation is uncertain because there
is very little data for $z>3$, and also it is unclear whether all damped
Ly$\alpha$ systems are associated with collapsed protogalaxies. The predictions
of CHDM are quite sensitive to the hot (neutrino) fraction, and we find that
$\Omega_c/\Omega_\nu/\Omega_b = 0.675/0.25/0.075$ is compatible even with the
$z>3$ data. This corresponds to lowering the neutrino mass from 6.8 to 5.7 eV,
for $H_0=50\kmsMpc$. In CHDM, the higher redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ systems are
predicted to have lower masses, which can be checked by measuring the velocity
widths of the associated metal line systems.

and the predicted Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) abundance falls monotonically
with increasing baryon density, deuterium places a reliable upper limit on the
baryon density of the universe. Because the new measurement is substationally
larger than previous, galactic estimates, it would force a reassessment of BBN
predictions--- if it is confirmed. Using a new BBN Monte Carlo code and
analysis technique \cite{KK} we derive constraints implied by a lower limit of
$D/H =1.9 \times 10^{-4}$. We find $\Omega_B \le .0068h^{-2}$, which is
definitively incompatible with baryonic halo dark matter. We also explore
implications of combining the D measurement with other light element

initial $^4He$ mass fraction ($Y_p$) would have to be less than $23.5\%$,

provides a framework for incorporating the results of previous work in

instead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In preliminary tests,
Pearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech and word (in speech

developed in an arduous, time-consuming manner by grammarians. A majority of
the grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first
hypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships
among words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections
to these rules.
  In this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical
parser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial
linguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly
endless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and
linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of
statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space
of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of
significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the
lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical
models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria
selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser
development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian
can when making individual disambiguation rules.
  In experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework,
and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both
using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser
significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure
which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78%
compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%.

approximated by a piecewise-linear loop with $N$ sufficiently large. The
formula is a sum of $O(N^4)$ polynomial and log terms, and is exact when the

large number of terms makes evaluation ``by hand"" impractical, but a computer

time-variables correspond to the elements of maximal nilpotent subalgebras
rather than Cartanian elements. Moreover, in the case of quantum groups such
$\tau$-``functions'' are not $c$-numbers but take their values in
non-commutative algebras (of functions on the quantum group $G$). Despite all
these differences from the particular case of conventional $\tau$-functions of
integrable (KP and Toda lattice) hierarchies (which arise when $G$ is a
Kac-Moody (1-loop) algebra of level $k=1$), these generic $\tau$-functions also
satisfy bilinear Hirota-like equations, which can be deduced from manipulations
with intertwining operators. The most important applications of the formalism
should be to $k>1$ Kac-Moody and multi-loop algebras, but this paper contains
only illustrative calculations for the simplest case of ordinary (0-loop)
algebra $SL(2)$ and its quantum counterpart $SL_q(2)$, as well as for the
