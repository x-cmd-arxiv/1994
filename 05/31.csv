Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups $G$ on compact Kaehler manifolds says
that the dimension of the $G$-invariant subspace is equal to the Riemann-Roch
number of the symplectically reduced space. Combined with the shifting-trick,
this gives explicit formulas for the multiplicities of the various irreducible
components. One of the assumptions of the Theorem is that the reduction is
regular, so that the reduced space is a smooth symplectic manifold. In this
paper, we prove a generalization of this result to the case where the reduced
space may have orbifold singularities. Our proof uses localization techniques
from equivariant cohomology, and relies in particular on recent work of
Jeffrey-Kirwan and Guillemin. Since there are no complex geometry arguments
involved, the result also extends to non Kaehlerian settings.

the detection of evolution in the X-ray luminosity function previously

remnant have revealed, in addition to the previously identified compact nebula,
a nearly circular emitting region with a radius of about 4 degrees. The Vela
pulsar is slightly off the center of this circular region, consistent with its
measured proper motion of about 100km/s and an age of about 10^4 yr. The
emitting region is bounded by the main supernova shock. Just outside the shock,
the X-ray image reveals several well-defined V-shaped features extending
radially outwards. These features are most likely wakes produced by objects
moving supersonically through the outside medium. The shapes and orientations
of the wakes suggest that these objects have been ejected from the center of
the supernova explosion. Their present positions indicate that they have been
moving with a mean velocity of a few thousand km/s. We show that pre-existing
objects, such as planets in orbit around the progenitor star, could not have
been accelerated to sufficiently high velocities or would have been destroyed.
Instead, we propose that the observed objects are fragments ejected during the
formation of the neutron star. Fragmentation during gravitational collapse is a
natural consequence of both convective and rotational instabilities.

considered. The general tools developed in a companion paper are applied to
compute the local cohomology of the BRST differential $s$ modulo the exterior
spacetime derivative $d$ for all values of the ghost number, in the space of
polynomials in the fields, the ghosts, the antifields (=sources for the BRST
variations) and their derivatives. New solutions to the consistency conditions
$sa+db=0$ depending non trivially on the antifields are exhibited. For a
semi-simple gauge group, however, these new solutions arise only at ghost
number two or higher. Thus at ghost number zero or one, the inclusion of the
antifields does not bring in new solutions to the consistency condition
$sa+db=0$ besides the already known ones. The analysis does not use power
counting and is purely cohomological. It can be easily extended to more general
actions containing higher derivatives of the curvature, or Chern-Simons terms.

  Eq. 12 on ultralocality corrected",,,,"hep-th",,"  The tensionless limit of classical string theory may be formulated as a
topological theory on the world-sheet. A vector density carries geometrical
information in place of an internal metric. It is found that path-integral
quantization allows for the definition of several, possibly inequivalent
quantum theories. String amplitudes are constructed from vector densities with
zeroes for each in- or out-going string. It is shown that independence of a
metric in quantum mechanical amplitudes implies that the dependence on such
vector density zeroes is purely topological. For example, there is no need for
integration over their world-sheet positions.

  sets",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1994/9","math.DS",,"  Given a $C^{1+\gamma}$ hyperbolic Cantor set $C$, we study the sequence
$C_{n,x}$ of Cantor subsets which nest down toward a point $x$ in $C$. We show
that $C_{n,x}$ is asymptotically equal to an ergodic Cantor set valued process.
The values of this process, called limit sets, are indexed by a H\""older
continuous set-valued function defined on D. Sullivan's dual Cantor set. We
show the limit sets are themselves $C^{k+\gamma}, C^\infty$ or $C^\omega$
hyperbolic Cantor sets, with the highest degree of smoothness which occurs in
the $C^{1+\gamma}$ conjugacy class of $C$. The proof of this leads to the
following rigidity theorem: if two $C^{k+\gamma}, C^\infty$ or $C^\omega$
hyperbolic Cantor sets are $C^1$-conjugate, then the conjugacy (with a
different extension) is in fact already $C^{k+\gamma}, C^\infty$ or $C^\omega$.
  Within one $C^{1+\gamma}$ conjugacy class, each smoothness class is a Banach
manifold, which is acted on by the semigroup given by rescaling subintervals.
Conjugacy classes nest down, and contained in the intersection of them all is a
compact set which is the attractor for the semigroup: the collection of limit
sets. Convergence is exponentially fast, in the $C^1$ norm.

of chaoticity is sensitive to the the strength of the residual interaction as
