X-ray luminosity function and its evolution in terms of a coalescence model (as
presented in the analysis of a flux limited X-ray cluster sample by Edge et al.
1990), as well as a simple virialised structure for the clusters (which
requires a gas to total mass fraction $\approxgt 0.1$ in order to reproduce
observed properties of nearby clusters) we show that the Compton distortion $y$
parameter is about two orders of magnitude below the current FIRAS upper
limits. Concerning the anisotropies imprinted on arcmin scales they are
dominated by the hottest undetected objects. We show that they are negligible
(${\Delta T\over T}\approxlt 10^{-7}$) at wavelengths $\lambda\approxgt 1$~mm.
At shorter wavelengths they become more important (${\Delta T\over T}\sim
10^{-6}$ at $\lambda\sim 0.3$~mm), but in fact most clusters will produce an
isolated and detectable feature in sky maps. After removal of these signals,
the fluctuations imprinted by the remaining clusters on the residual radiation
are still much smaller. The conclusion is that X-ray clusters can be ignored as
sources of Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations.

$6000-6600$~K, the $^7$Li/$^6$Li ratio on the subgiant branch should increase
as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$ if flare production is important, whereas the
same ratio should be constant if a protostellar origin is the source of the

that the appearence of sources as quasars or radio galaxies can depend on the

class of low energy hadronic properties to examine consistency with
experimental results. Phase transition of chiral symmetry breaking is described
through explicit vacuum realignment. We find that for the present ansatz,
vacuum structure of the light quark sector can be determined from $f_\pi=92$
MeV, which then yields that $\Gamma(\pi^0\rightarrow 2 \gamma)=8.3$ eV and,
$R_{ch}=0.67$ fms, in agreement with experiments. This amounts to three
independent `observations' of the vacuum structure of the light quark sector.
For the calculation of $\Gamma(\pi^0\rightarrow 2\gamma)$, we do not use the
anomaly equation - local gauge invariance for vacuum realignment becomes
adequate. The above width is sensitive to the vacuum structure, and can give
evidence regarding progress towards chiral symmetry restoration in QGP. The
corresponding results for $s$ quark sector are moderately good. We also exploit
similar ideas for heavy quarks, but here the experimental data are rare, and
the theoretical techniques are likely to need refinements.

exploiting the fact that the superpotential and the gauge coupling function are
holomorphic functions of the model parameters. The precise meaning of this
holomorphy is subtle, and has been explained most clearly by Shifman and
Vainshtein, who have stressed the role of the Wilsonian effective action. In
this note, we elaborate on the Shifman-Vainshtein program, applying it to
examples in grand unification, supersymmetric QCD and string theory. We stress
that among the ``model parameters"" are the cutoffs used to define the Wilsonian
action itself, and that generically these must be defined in a field-dependent
manner to obtain holomorphic results.

components. The solutions, which describe longitudinaly oscillating folded
strings (radial oscillations in 4D), must be given in lattice-like patches of
the worldsheet, and a transfer operation analogous to a transfer matrix
determines the future evolution. Then the swallowing of a string by a black
hole is analyzed. We find several new features that are not shared by particle
motions. The most surprizing effect is the tunneling of the string into the
bare singularity region that lies beyond the black hole that is classically
forbidden to particles.

$\p^*$ of the `pseudo-classical' model, are necessary for the covariant
formulation. The dynamical term for these extra variables is naturally obtained
and the meaning of the constraint term $p^\s\L_{\s\n}+mt_\n =0$, which was
recently shown to give `quasi-supersymmetry', is clarified.

the experimentally extracted PNC matrix element for $^{21}$Ne as a destructive
interference between the isoscalar and the isovector contribution, then it is
difficult to understand why the isovector contribution in $^{18}$F is so small
while the isoscalar + isovector contribution in $^{19}$F is relatively large.
In order to understand the origin of this discrepancy a comparison of the
calculated PNC matrix elements was performed. It is shown that the $^{18}$F and
$^{21}$Ne matrix elements contain important contributions from 3$\hbar \omega$
and 4$\hbar \omega$ configuration and that the (0+1)$\hbar \omega$ calculations
give distorted results.
