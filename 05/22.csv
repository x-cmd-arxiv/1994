a {\it gauge} theory of the extended Galilei group. In the present one we
derive two true generalizations of Newton's theory (a {\it ten-fields} and an
{\it eleven-fields} theory), in terms of an explicit Lagrangian realization of
the {\it absolute time} dynamics of a Riemannian three-space. They turn out to
be {\it gauge invariant} theories of the extended Galilei group in the same
sense in which general relativity is said to be a {\it gauge} theory of the
Poincar\'e group. The {\it ten-fields} theory provides a dynamical realization
of some of the so-called ``Newtonian space-time structures'' which have been
geometrically classified by K\""{u}nzle and Kucha\v{r}. The {\it eleven-fields}
theory involves a {\it dilaton-like} scalar potential in addition to Newton's
potential and, like general relativity, has a three-metric with {\it two}
dynamical degrees of freedom. It is interesting to find that, within the linear
approximation, such degrees of freedom show {\it graviton-like} features: they
satisfy a wave equation and propagate with a velocity related to the scalar
Newtonian potential.

of the order parameter and the fluctuations of a scalar field theory in
spatially flat FRW cosmologies. After setting the problem in general we propose
a non-perturbative, self-consistent Hartree approximation. The method consists
of evolving an initial functional thermal density matrix in time and is
suitable for studying phase transitions out of equilibrium. The renormalization
aspects are studied in detail and we find that the counterterms depend on the
initial state. We investigate the high temperature expansion and show that it
breaks down at long times. The infinite time limit is computed for de Sitter
spacetime. We obtain the time evolution of the initial Boltzmann distribution
functions, and argue that in the Hartree approximation, the time evolved state
is a ``squeezed'' state. We illustrate the departure from thermal equilibrium
by studying the case of a free field in de Sitter and radiation dominated
cosmologies. It is found that a suitably defined non-equilibrium entropy per
mode increases linearly with comoving time in a de Sitter cosmology, whereas it
is {\it not} a monotonically increasing function in the radiation dominated
case. This work has been done in collaboration with D. Boyanovsky and R.
Holman.

We exploit the fact that quantum non-compact algebras such as $U_q(su(1,1))$
and type-I quantum superalgebras such as $U_q(gl(1|1))$ and $U_q(gl(2|1))$ are
known to admit non-trivial one-parameter families of infinite-dimensional and
finite dimensional irreps, respectively, even for generic $q$. We develop a
technique for constructing the corresponding spectral-dependent R-matrices. As
examples we work out the the $R$-matrices for the three quantum algebras
mentioned above in certain representations.

described by a 1+1 dimensional (conformal) field theory of $d$ massless scalar
fields taking values on a $d$-dimensional torus. It is known from the work of
Naculich, Frohlich et al.\@ and others that the requirement of chirality of
currents in this \underline{scalar} field theory implies the Schwinger anomaly
in the presence of an electric field, the anomaly coefficient being related in
a specific way to Hall conducvivity. The latter can take only certain
restricted values with odd denominators if the theory admits fermionic states.
We show that the duality symmetry under the $O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ group of the free
theory transforms the Hall conductivity in a well-defined way and relates
integer and fractional QHE's. This means, in particular, that the edge spectra
for dually related Hall conductivities are identical, a prediction which may be
experimentally testable. We also show that Haldane's hierarchy as well as
certain of Jain's fractions can be reproduced from the Laughlin fractions using
the duality transformations. We thus find a framework for a unified description
of the QHE's occurring at different fractions. We also give a derivation of the
wave functions for fractions in Haldane's hierarchy.
