infrared galaxy NGC~6240, obtained using the VLA at 20~cm in `B' configuration
and at 3.6~cm in `A' configuration. These data, along with those from four
previous VLA observations, are used to perform a comprehensive study of the
radio emission from NGC~6240. Approximately 70\% (~3 x 10$^{23}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$)
of the total radio power at 20 cm originates from the nuclear region ( <~ 1.5
kpc), of which half is emitted by two unresolved ($R <~ 36 pc) cores and half
by a diffuse component. The radio spectrum of the nuclear emission is
relatively flat ($\alpha$ =~ 0.6; $S_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$). The
supernova rate required to power the diffuse component is consistent with that
predicted by the stellar evolution models of Rieke \etal (1985). If the radio
emission from the two compact cores is powered by supernova remnants, then
either the remnants overlap and form hot bubbles in the cores, or they are very
young ( <~ 100 yr). Nearly all of the other 30\% of the total radio power comes
from an ``arm-like'' region extending westward from the nuclear region. The
western arm emission has a steep spectrum ($\alpha$ =~ 1.0), suggestive of
aging effects from synchrotron or inverse-Compton losses, and is not correlated
with starlight; we suggest that it is synchrotron emission from a shell of
material driven by a galactic superwind. Inverse-Compton scattering of
far-infrared photons in the radio sources is expected to produce an X-ray flux
of ~2-6 x 10$^{-14}$ erg/s/cm2 in the 2-10 keV band. No significant radio
emission is detected from or near the possible ultra-massive ``dark core''
hypothesized by Bland-Hawthorn, Wilson \& Tully (1991).

systematically different from those of the Second Reference Catalogue (de

to systematic differences in growth curves and fiducial H magnitudes, prompting
the present recalibration of the near-infrared Tully Fisher relationship. New
optically-normalized H magnitude growth curves are defined for galaxies of
types S0 to Im, from which new values of fiducial H magnitudes, H$\rm

Aaronson et al. values of diameters, axial ratios and fiducial H magnitudes
show the expected differences, given the different definitions of these

value of 1 indicates an accuracy of $<$0.2 magnitude; Quality 2 indicates an
accuracy of 0.2 to 0.35 mag; and Quality 3 indicates $>$0.35 mag. Revised

front while the inner shell is swept-up by the fast wind. These models explain
the emission profiles of the outer shells as well as their various kinematic
properties. Because they are shaped by the ionization front these outer shells
only give indirect information on the AGB mass loss history. The models
indicate that typical MSPN structures point to mass loss variations during the

corrections in terms of transverse separations. We parallel the analysis given
previously by Li and make apparent a number of serious objections. The
appropriate cut-off needed to render the form-factor calculation finite is both
detailed and analyzed by considering different cut-off prescriptions. The use
of the maximum interquark separation as a common infrared cut-off in the
Sudakov suppression factor is proposed, since it avoids difficulties with the
$\alpha _{s}$-singularities and yields a proton form factor insensitive to the
inclusion of the soft region which therefore can be confidently attributed to
perturbative QCD. Results are presented for a variety of proton wave functions
including also their intrinsic transverse momentum. It turns out that the
perturbative contribution, although theoretically self-consistent for $Q^{2}$
larger than about $6$~GeV${}^{2}$ to $10$~GeV${}^{2}$, is too small compared to
the data.

generated from the $q-1$ gravitational primaries by acting one of the ring
generators in the R-sector on them repeatedly. After fixing the normalizations
of the dressed scaling operators, we find that the Ward identities are
expressed in the form of the {\it usual} $\W_q$ algebra constraints as in the
bosonic case: $\W^{(k+1)}_n \tau =0$, $(k=1,\cdots,q-1 ;~ n \in {\bf Z}_{\geq

and found to be identical to a random surface coupled to a q-states Potts model
with q = inf. The mean field-like solution exhibits a novel type of tree
structure. The natural question is, down to which--if any--finite values of c
and q does this behavior persist? In this work we develop, for the Potts model,
an expansion in the fluctuations about the q = inf. mean field solution. In the
lowest--cubic--non-trivial order in this expansion the corrections to mean
field theory can be given a nice interpretation in terms of structures (trees
and ``galaxies'') of spin clusters. When q drops below a finite q_c, the
galaxies overwhelm the trees at all temperatures, thus suppressing mean field
behavior. Thereafter the phase diagram resembles that of the Ising model, q=2.
