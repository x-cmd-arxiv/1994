Markov Models from data which is based on the general `model merging' strategy
(Omohundro 1992). The process begins with a maximum likelihood HMM that
directly encodes the training data. Successively more general models are
produced by merging HMM states. A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is
used to determine which states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The
procedure may be considered a heuristic search for the HMM structure with the
highest posterior probability. We discuss a variety of possible priors for
HMMs, as well as a number of approximations which improve the computational
efficiency of the algorithm. We studied three applications to evaluate the
procedure. The first compares the merging algorithm with the standard
Baum-Welch approach in inducing simple finite-state languages from small,
positive-only training samples. We found that the merging procedure is more
robust and accurate, particularly with a small amount of training data. The
second application uses labelled speech data from the TIMIT database to build
compact, multiple-pronunciation word models that can be used in speech
recognition. Finally, we describe how the algorithm was incorporated in an
operational speech understanding system, where it is combined with neural
network acoustic likelihood estimators to improve performance over

qualitatively discuss the constraints on the signal for this process and
calculate the hadronic monoslepton production cross section, taking into
account leading QCD corrections. Our results show the leading corrections could
be quite significant at the proposed LHC operating energy.

\linebreak $B(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)$ and $B(K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$ can in a
theoretically clean manner determine $\sin 2\beta$ almost independently of
$m_t$ and $V_{cb}$. This allows to obtain an interesting relation between the
CP asymmetry $A_{CP}(\psi K_S)$ in B physics and the branching ratios for these
two rare K decays. The recently calculated next-to-leading order QCD
corrections improve the accuracy of this analysis. We find typically
$\Delta\sin 2\beta=\pm 0.11$ provided $B(\kpn)$ and $B(\klpn)$ are measured
within $\pm 10\%$ accuracy. With decreasing uncertainty in
$\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}$ and $m_c$ this error could be reduced to $\Delta\sin
2\beta < \pm 0.10$. The determination of $\sin 2\alpha$ and $\sin 2\gamma$ on
the other hand is rather poor. However respectable determinations of the
Wolfenstein parameter $\eta$ and of $\mid V_{td}\mid$ can be obtained.
