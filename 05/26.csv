radiation by thermal Comptonization of soft photons. We find that the maximum
luminosity to size ratio of the source (i.e. the compactness) depends not only
on the hot plasma temperature, but also on the spectral index of the resulting
Comptonized spectrum. In the observationally interesting range, sources of same
compactness can be hotter if their spectrum is steeper. Instruments observing
in the 50--500 keV energy range, such as OSSE on board CGRO, and especially the
future SAX satellite, can be more successful in detecting sources moderately
steep, the flattest sources being characterized by an high energy cut--off at
too low frequencies. For any given pair of values of spectral index and
temperature, Comptonization theory alone fixes the $ratio$ of the compactnesses
in hard and soft photons. However, if the source is pair dominated, the
absolute values of the two compactnesses are fixed. Therefore there is a a
one--to--one correspondence between the physical parameters of the source (the
compactnesses in soft and hard photons) and the observable quantities (spectral
index and temperature). This correspondence can be extremely useful in
interpreting the physical behaviour of the sources, especially during
variations, and can help discriminating between different models for the high
energy emission of compact sources.

reionization of the universe at $z=z_{ion}\gg 10$. We find the correlation

obtained probability distribution, we calculate the mass fraction of black

qualitatively with those of Chernoff \& Weinberg (1990), who used a

found by Chernoff \& Weinberg, sometimes by as much as an order of magnitude.

area produced by the blobs, impinging on the disk, can easily dominate the
radiation internally produced by the disk. In this case the electron
temperature and the high energy spectrum can be determined in a similar way as
in the previously studied homogeneous model (Haardt \& Maraschi 1991). However
in the present model: a) the emitted spectrum is largely independent of the
{\it fraction} of gravitational power dissipated in the blobs; b) the X--ray
spectrum can be harder depending on a form factor of the blobs; c) the UV (or
soft X--ray for galactic objects) luminosity that is not intercepted by the
blobs can be larger than the X--ray luminosity. In the framework of a
simplified accretion disk $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo model, we make order of
magnitude estimates of the number of active blobs, their size, luminosity and
hence their compactness, finding values in agreement with what is observed. The
expected UV to X--ray spectra and correlations of X--ray and UV light curves

of mediating between surface linguistic string and their representations as
``literal'' logical forms: the focus of interest will be the question of
relating ``literal'' logical forms to representations in terms of primitives
meaningful to the underlying database engine. We begin by describing the nature
of the problem, and show how a variety of interface functionalities can be
considered as instances of a type of formal inference task which we call
``Abductive Equivalential Translation'' (AET); functionalities which can be
reduced to this form include answering questions, responding to commands,
reasoning about the completeness of answers, answering meta-questions of type
``Do you know...'', and generating assertions and questions. In each case, a
``linguistic domain theory'' (LDT) $\Gamma$ and an input formula $F$ are given,
and the goal is to construct a formula with certain properties which is
equivalent to $F$, given $\Gamma$ and a set of permitted assumptions. If the
LDT is of a certain specified type, whose formulas are either conditional
equivalences or Horn-clauses, we show that the AET problem can be reduced to a
goal-directed inference method. We present an abstract description of this
method, and sketch its realization in Prolog. The relationship between AET and
several problems previously discussed in the literature is discussed. In
particular, we show how AET can provide a simple and elegant solution to the
so-called ``Doctor on Board'' problem, and in effect allows a
``relativization'' of the Closed World Assumption. The ideas in the thesis have
all been implemented concretely within the SRI CLARE project, using a real

proposed by Frolov and Slavnov , it is important to specify how to sum the
contributions from an infinite number of regulator fields. It is shown that an
explicit sum of contributions from an infinite number of fields in anomaly-free
gauge theory essentially results in a specific choice of regulator in the past
formulation of covariant anomalies. We show this correspondence by
reformulating the generalized Pauli- Villars regularization as a regularization
of composite current operators. We thus naturally understand why the covariant
fermion number anomaly in the Weinberg-Salam theory is reproduced in the
generalized Pauli-Villars regularization. A salient feature of the covariant
regularization,which is not implemented in the lagrangian level in general but
works for any chiral theory and gives rise to covariant anomalies , is that it
spoils the Bose symmetry in anomalous theory. The covariant regularization
however preserves the Bose symmetry as well as gauge invariance in anomaly-free
gauge theory.
