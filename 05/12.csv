distant rich cluster AC114 (z=0.31) reveal a variety of gravitational lensing
phenomena for which ground-based spectroscopy is available. We present a
luminous arc which is clearly resolved by HST and appears to be a lensed z=0.64
sub-L star spiral galaxy with a detected rotation curve. Of greatest interest
is a remarkably symmetrical pair of compact blue images separated by 10 arcsec
and lying close to the cluster cD. We propose that these images arise from a
single very faint background source gravitationally lensed by the cluster core.
Deep ground-based spectroscopy confirms the lensing hypothesis and suggests the
source is a compact star forming system at a redshift z=1.86. Taking advantage
of the resolved structure around each image and their very blue colours, we
have identified a candidate third image of the same source roughly 50 arcsec
away. The angular separation of the three images is much larger than previous
multiply-imaged systems and indicates a deep gravitational potential in the
cluster centre. Resolved multiply-imaged systems, readily recognised with HST,
promise to provide unique constraints on the mass distribution in the cores of
intermediate redshift clusters.

is implicit in the smoothing procedures adopted. Thus the possibility arises of
using nonradial line integrals to derive a smoothed velocity field. For an
inhomogeneous galaxy distribution the optimal path for integration need not be
radial, and can be obtained using max-flow algorithms. In this paper we
describe how one may use Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain this optimal path and
velocity field, and present the results of applying the algorithm to a
realistic spatial distribution of galaxies. These results show that the method
has limited effect due to the large smoothing scales employed in Potent.
However, the viability of the technique is demonstrated and, finally, we
discuss other possible methods involving averaging over an ensemble of
non-radial paths for improving a potential velocity field derived from

(~100 Crab), gamma-ray bursts. We report an analysis of the x-ray emission from
95 SGR1806-20 events observed by the International Cometary Explorer. The
spectral shape remains remarkably constant for bursts that differ in intensity
by a range of 50. Below 15 keV the number spectrum falls off rapidly such that
we can estimate the total intensity of the events. Assuming that SGR1806-20 is
associated with the supernova remnant G10.0-0.3 (Kulkarni and Frail, Murakami
\etal), the brightest events had a total luminosity of ~1.8 x 10^42 erg sec^-1,
a factor of 2 x 10^4 above the Eddington limit. A third of the emission was
above 30 keV. There are at least three processes that are consistent with the
spectral rollover below 15 keV. (1)The rollover is consistent with some forms
of self absorption. Typical thermal temperatures are ~20 keV and require an
emitting surface with a radius between 10 and 50 km. The lack of spectral
variability implies that only the size of the emitting surface varies between
events. If the process is thermal synchrotron the required magnetic field might
be too small to confine the plasma against the super Eddington flux. (2)The low
energy rollover could be due to photoelectric absorption by ~10^24 Hydrogen
atoms cm^-2 of neutral material with a cosmic abundance assuming a continuum
similar to TB with T= ~22 keV. (3) Emission in the two lowest harmonics from a
1.3 x 10^12 Gauss field would appear as Doppler broadened lines and fall off
rapidly below 15 keV.

in the past few years that it also poses a multi-faceted challenge. In order to
compute the tiny primordial baryonic excess, we probably must invoke physics
beyond the standard model (an exciting prospect for most people), we must push
perturbation theory to its ``limits'' (or beyond), and we must deal with
nonequilibrium aspects of the phase transition. In this talk, I focus mainly on
the latter issue, that of nonequilibrium aspects of first order transitions. In
particular, I discuss the elusive question of ``weakness''. What does it mean
to have a weak first order transition, and how can we distinguish between weak
and strong? I argue that weak and strong transitions have very different
dynamics; while strong transitions proceed by the usual bubble nucleation
mechanism, weak transitions are characterized by a mixing of phases as the
system reaches the critical temperature from above. I show that it is possible
to clearly distinguish between the two, and discuss consequences for studies of
first order transitions in general. (Invited talk given at the ``Electroweak

$N_F > 2$, there are ambiguities in the extrapolation away from $N = 3$ because
the baryon flavor multiplets for a given spin grow with $N$. I argue that the
$1/N$ expansion is valid for baryons with spin $O(1)$ and {\it arbitrary}
flavor quantum numbers, including e.g. baryons with isospin and/or strangeness
$O(N)$. This allows the formulation of a large-$N$ expansion in which it is not

theory factors must be evaluated explicitly only for $N_F = N = 3$. To
illustrate this expansion, I consider the non-singlet axial currents, baryon

approach) were classified in J.Wang, B.Parshall, Memoirs AMS 439 in the~case of
$q$ being an~odd root of unity. Here we find the~irreducible representations
for all roots of unity (also of an~even degree), as well as describe
""the~diagonal part"" of tensor product of any two irreducible representations.
An~example of not completely reducible representation is given. Non--existence
of Haar functional is proved. The~corresponding representations of universal
enveloping algebras of Jimbo and Lusztig are provided. We also recall the~case
of general~$q$. Our computations are done in explicit way.

$\lambda(X)$ denote Lebesgue measure. If $X\subseteq [0,1]$ and $r \in (0,1)$
then the $r$-Hausdorff capacity of $X$ is denoted by $H^r(X)$ and is defined to
be the infimum of all $\sum_{i=0}^\infty \lambda(I_i)^r$ where
$\{I_i\}_{i\in\omega}$ is a cover of $X$ by intervals. The $r$ Hausdorff
capacity has the same null sets as the $r$-Hausdorff measure which is familiar
from the theory of fractal dimension. It is shown that, given $r < 1$, it is
possible to enlarge a model of set theory, $V$, by a generic extension $V[G]$
so that the reals of $V$ have Lebesgue measure zero but still have positive
$r$-Hausdorff capacity.

asymmetry for elastic scattering of polarized electrons from $^4$He are
calculated over a range of momentum transfer using Monte Carlo methods and a
variational $^4$He ground state wavefunction. The results indicate that MEC's
generate a negligible contribution to the asymmetry at low-$|\qv|$, where a
determination of the nucleon's mean square strangeness radius could be carried
out at CEBAF. At larger values of momentum transfer -- beyond the first
diffraction minimum -- two-body corrections from the $\rho$-$\pi$ \lq\lq
strangeness charge"" operator enter the asymmetry at a potentially observable
level, even in the limit of vanishing strange-quark matrix elements of the
nucleon. For purposes of constraining the nucleon's strangeness electric form
factor, theoretical uncertainties associated with these MEC contributions do
not appear to impose serious limitations.
