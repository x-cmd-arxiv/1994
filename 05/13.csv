  classes","18 pages, LaTeX",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  In \cite{K} we introduced two variants of higher-order differentials of the
period map and showed how to compute them for a variation of Hodge structure
that comes from a deformation of a compact K\""ahler manifold. More recently
there appeared several works (\cite{BG}, \cite{EV}, \cite{R}) defining higher
tangent spaces to the moduli and the corresponding higher Kodaira-Spencer
classes of a deformation. The $n^{th}$ such class $\kappa_n$ captures all
essential information about the deformation up to $n^{th}$ order. A well-known
result of Griffiths states that the (first) differential of the period map
depends only on the (first) Kodaira-Spencer class of the deformation. In this
paper we show that the second differential of the Archimedean period map
associated to a deformation is determined by $\kappa_2$ taken modulo the image
of $\kappa_1$, whereas the second differential of the usual period map, as well
as the second fundamental form of the VHS, depend only on $\kappa_1$ (Theorems
2, 5, and 6 in Section~3). Presumably, similar statements are valid in
higher-order cases (see Section~4).

in the recently proposed hybrid inflationary scenario. An observational upper
limit on {\em n} is derived by normalizing the spectrum at the quadrupole scale
and considering the possible overproduction of Planck mass relics formed in the
final stage of primordial black hole evaporation. In the inflationary Universe
with the maximum reheating temperature compatible with the observed quadrupole
anisotropy, the upper limit is $n=1.4$, but it is slightly weaker for lower
reheat temperatures. This limit applies over 57 decades of mass and is
therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and any gravitational wave
contribution to the quadrupole anisotropy. It is also independent of the dark
matter content of the Universe and therefore the bias parameter. In some
circumstances, there may be an extended dust-like phase between the end of
inflation and reheating. In this case, primordial black holes form more
abundantly and the upper limit is $n=1.3$.

severely constrain the possibilities. The simplest choice found corresponds to
a nonlinear Liouville-type boundary interaction. The scattering of low-energy
matter off the boundary can be computed perturbatively. It is found that weak
incident pulses induce damped oscillations at the boundary while large incident
pulses produce black holes. The response of the boundary to such pulses is
semi-classically characterized by a second order, nonlinear ordinary
differential equation which is analyzed numerically.

cannot be understood as an operation on the space of manifolds with vanishing
first Chern class. In this article I continue to investigate a particular type
of K\""ahler manifolds with positive first Chern class which generalize
Calabi--Yau manifolds in a natural way and which provide a framework for
mirrors of rigid string vacua. This class is comprised of a special type of
Fano manifolds which encode crucial information about ground states of the
superstring. It is shown in particular that the massless spectra of
$(2,2)$--supersymmetric vacua of central charge $\hat{c}=D_{crit}$ can be
derived from special Fano varieties of complex dimension $(D_{crit}+2(Q-1))$,
$Q>1$, and that in certain circumstances it is even possible to embed
Calabi--Yau manifolds into such higher dimensional spaces. The constructions
described here lead to new insight into the relation between exactly solvable
models and their mean field theories on the one hand and their corresponding
Calabi--Yau manifolds on the other. It is furthermore shown that Witten's
formulation of the Landau--Ginzburg/Calabi--Yau relation can be applied to the
present framework as well.

realized as the nerve of a packing of (non-congruent) circles in R^3. We
investigate the average kissing number of finite packings of non-congruent
spheres in R^3 as a first restriction on the possible nerves of such packings.
We show that the supremum k of the average kissing number for all packings
satisfies
  12.566 ~ 666/53 <= k < 8 + 4*sqrt(3) ~ 14.928
  We obtain the upper bound by a resource exhaustion argument and the upper
bound by a construction involving packings of spherical caps in S^3. Our result
contradicts two naive conjectures about the average kissing number: That it is
unbounded, or that it is supremized by an infinite packing of congruent
spheres.
