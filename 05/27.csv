used to estimate the mass interior to the arcs and therefore, constrain the
cluster mass distribution. The radial density distribution of the intracluster
gas (ICM) can be extracted from the X-ray surface brightness observations. If
the gas temperature is also known, it is then possible to probe the dynamical
state of the gas and test whether the ICM is in hydro- static equilibrium
within the gravitational potential of the cluster as a result of thermal
pressure support. We analyze three clusters that exhibit large arcs, whose
X-ray surface brightness profiles have been observed, and whose gas
temperatures have been determined. In two of the clusters, A2218 and A1689, the
central mass implied by lensing is a factor of $2$--$2.5$ too large for the gas
at the observed temperature to be in hydrostatic equilibrium solely due to
thermal pressure support. In other words, if we accept the mass estimate
derived from the lensing analysis and demand that the X-ray surface brightness
profile be consistent with the observations, the required gas temperature is a
factor of $2$--$2.5$ higher than observed. The results for the third cluster,
A2163 (the most luminous and the hottest cluster known), are more ambiguous.
The discrepancy between the X-ray and the lensing mass estimates arise because
the presence of arcs imply a highly concentrated cluster mass distribution
whereas the observed X-ray profiles imply a more extended mass distribution.
The large X-ray core radii are not the result of the limited resolution of the
X-ray detectors. We consider various possibilities that could account for the
discrepancy.

the momentum density ${\bf g}$. As a first approximation, we consider the case
where motions associated with $n$ are much slower than those associated with

certain limit of a very shallow metastable well and a weak coupling between

describing the observed sequence of time relaxations are given as smooth
functions of the temperature without any evidence for a special temperature. We
then investigate the case where the defect dynamics is included. We find that

can be used to deal with manifolds of any dimension which are endowed with
nothing more than an affine connection, and requires a family \calc\ of curves
satisfying a {\em bounded parameter property} to be specified at the outset.
All affinely parametrised geodesics are usually included in this family, but
different choices of family \calc\ will in general lead to different
singularity structures. Our key notion is the {\em abstract boundary\/} or {\em
$a$-boundary\/} of a manifold, which is defined for any manifold \calm\ and is
independent of both the affine connection and the chosen family \calc\ of
curves. The $a$-boundary is made up of equivalence classes of boundary points
of \calm\ in all possible open embeddings. It is shown that for a
pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(\calm,g)$ with a specified family \calc\ of
curves, the abstract boundary points can then be split up into four main
categories---regular, points at infinity, unapproachable points and
singularities. Precise definitions are also provided for the notions of a {\em
removable singularity} and a {\em directional singularity}. The
pseudo-Riemannian manifold will be said to be singularity-free if its abstract
boundary contains no singularities. The scheme passes a number of tests
required of any theory of singularities. For instance, it is shown that all
compact manifolds are singularity-free, irrespective of the metric and chosen
family \calc.

can reach a short distance domain that has not been pre-explored by QED. This
is in contrast with all previous tests of the dispersion relations. We argue
that the most likely property of QFT to fail is polynomial boundedness. In a
theory with `fundamental length', R, we study the consequences of having
exponential behavior in the amplitude of the form (exp$\pm i\sqrt{s}\;R)$, as
suggested by different models. We show that such a behavior makes a significant
and measurable contribution to $\rho$ even at energies where $(\sqrt{s}\;R)$ is
still small, O(0.1). Talk delivered at Les Rencontres de Physique de la Vallee

natural gauge choice in the zero mode sector is identified, for which the
constraint relations are simplest and the fields may be taken to satisfy the

the formation of complex patterns. The first is an instability to transverse
modulations that drives the formation of labyrinthine patterns. The second is a
Nonequilibrium Ising-Bloch (NIB) bifurcation that renders a stationary planar
front unstable and gives rise to a pair of counterpropagating fronts. Near the
NIB bifurcation the relation of the front velocity to curvature is highly
nonlinear and transitions between counterpropagating fronts become feasible.
Nonuniformly curved fronts may undergo local front transitions that nucleate
spiral-vortex pairs. These nucleation events provide the ingredient needed to
initiate spot splitting and spiral turbulence. Similar spatio-temporal
processes have been observed recently in the ferrocyanide-iodate-sulfite
reaction.
