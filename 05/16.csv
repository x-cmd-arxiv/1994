considered in a simple, but accurate, model based upon the diffusion
approximation. The tau-neutrinosphere temperature is found to increase with
mass so that emission of massive tau neutrinos is not suppressed by the
Boltzmann factor previously used, $(\mnu /T_\nu )^{1.5}\exp(-\mnu/T_{\nu})$,
where $T_{\nu}\sim 4\MeV -8\MeV$. If the tau neutrino decays to electron
neutrinos, then for short lifetimes ($\taunu\la10^{-3}\sec$) the location of
both the tau and electron neutrinospheres can be affected, and, for very short
lifetimes ($\tau_\nu \la 10^{-6}\sec$) its temperature falls below $1\MeV$, in
conflict with neutrino observations of Supernova 1987A (SN 87A). Using our
results, we revise limits to the mass/lifetime of an $\MeV$-mass tau neutrino
based upon SN 87A. Our constraints, together with bounds based upon primordial
nucleosynthesis and the laboratory mass limit of around $30\MeV$, exclude the
possibility of a tau neutrino more massive than $0.4\MeV$ if the dominant decay
mode is radiative. Finally, we speculate on the possible role a $15\MeV
-25\MeV$ tau neutrino might play in the supernova explosion itself.

Therefore possible supersymmetric structure can be probed provided the accuracy
of measurements for $\Delta k_{\gamma}$, $\Delta Q_{\gamma}$ reaches
$10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ and hence hard to be detected at LEP2. If deviations from the
standard model predictions are observed at LEP2, most likely these are not due

the LEP2 sensitivity limits. This occurs when their masses $m_{\tilde

of projectors.These algebras are then combined by additional relations in a way
which generalizes the Birman-Wenzl algebra.In this paper we Yang-Baxterize the
algebra BH and compute solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.The solutions
found are expressed algebraically in terms of the generators of the algebra.The
expression generalizes the known one for the Birman-Wenzl algebra.

Fukuma and Shapere. We concentrate on the model defined by taking a deformation
$\D{G}$ of the quantum double of a finite commutative group $G$ as the
underlying Hopf algebra. It is suggested that Chung-Fukuma-Shapere partition
function is related to that of Dijkgraaf-Witten by $\zcfs = |\zdw|^2$ when
$G=\Z_{2N+1}$. For $G=\Z_{2N}$, such a relation does not hold.
