of the central region of the Sun. Four solar neutrino experiments have
confirmed the solar neutrino problem but do not clearly indicate whether solar
physics, nuclear physics, or neutrino physics have to be improved to solve it.
Nonlinear relations among the different neutrino fluxes are imposed by two
coupled systems of differential equations governing the internal structure and
time evolution of the Sun. We assume that the results of the four neutrino
experiments are correct and are concerned not with the discrepancy between the
average rate and the predicted rate, but with a possible time dependence of the
argon production rate as revealed in the Homestake experiment over a time
period of 20 years. Based on the subtlety of the solar neutrino problem we
review here quantitatively the physical laws employed for understanding the
internal solar structure and conjecture that the interlink between specific
nuclear reactions of the PPIII-branch of the proton-proton chain may allow the
high-energy solar neutrino flux to vary over time.

Omega<1. Such models have received recent interest because the excess power in
the large-scale galaxy distribution is phenomenologically fit if the ``shape
parameter"" Gamma=h Omega_0 is about 0.25. It has been argued that such models
may require early reionization to suppress small-scale anisotropies in order to
be consistent with experimental data. We find that if the cosmological constant
lambda=0, the extent of this suppression is quite insensitive to Omega_0. Given
a sigma_8-normalization today, the loss of small-scale power associated with a
lower Omega_0 is partially canceled by higher optical depth from longer
lookback times and by structures forming at higher redshifts before the
universe becomes curvature-dominated. The maximum angular scale on which
fluctuations are suppressed decreases when Omega_0 is lowered, but this effect
is also rather weak and unlikely to be measurable in the near future. For flat
models, on the other hand, where lambda_0 = 1-Omega_0, the negative effects of
lowering Omega_0 dominate, and early reionization is not likely to play a
significant role if Omega_0<<1. The same applies to CDM models where the
effective Gamma is lowered by increasing the number of relativistic particle
species.

The calculated $L^{-1}$ is in very good agreement with the low-temperature

Monte Carlo techniques. However, the finite temperature structure of $\gamma$,
as a function of magnetic field, is \underline{sharper} than the

equation at small $x$ as a two--dimensional wave equation, which propagates the
gluon distribution from its boundaries into the asymptotic region. We then show
that the existing experimental data on $F_2^p(x,Q^2)$ from HERA provide a
remarkable confirmation of both of these scaling predictions. The so--called
`hard' pomeron, which does not scale, may thus be excluded by more than three
standard deviations, at least in the presently accessible kinematical regime.
We propose that existing and future data from HERA should be binned in the two
scaling variables, in order to search for scaling violations.

asymmetry and isospin breaking explanations for the violation of the Gottfried
sum rule. Consequences from three different forms of corrections to the flavor

calculated results are sensitive to the choices of parameters and parton
distributions, and to the ways the corrections are introduced. All three forms
of corrections could be consistent with the recent Fermilab Experiment E772

shape of the differential cross section $m^{3}d^{2}\sigma/dx_{F}dm$ for

supports in the presence of a homogeneous background electric charge density
the existence of smooth, finite-energy topologically stable flux vortices. The
static properties of such vortices are studied numerically in the context of a
two parameter model describing this system as a special case. It is shown that
the electrostatic and the mexican hat potential terms of the energy are each
enough to ensure the existence of vortex solutions. The interaction potential
of two minimal vortices is obtained for various values of the parameters. It is
proven analytically that a free isolated vortex with topological charge $N\ne
0$ is spontaneously pinned, while in the presence of an external force it moves
at a calculable speed and in a direction $(N/|N|) 90^0$ relative to it. In a
homogeneous external current $\tilde {\bf J}$ the vortex velocity is $\bf
V=-\tilde J$. Other theories with the same vortex behaviour are briefly
discussed.
