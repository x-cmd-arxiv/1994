  STPHY-TH/94-7",,,,"nucl-th hep-th",,"  We demonstrate that exact supersymmetry can emerge in a purely fermionic
system. This ""supersymmetry without bosons"" is unveiled by constructing a novel
boson-fermion Dyson mapping from a fermion space to a space comprised of
collective bosons and ideal fermions. In a nuclear structure context the
collective spectra of even and odd nuclei can then be unified in a
supersymmetric description with Pauli correlations still exactly taken into
account.
