field was present before recombination and follow the field's effect on the
baryon fluid starting at recombination. We find that magnetic fields generate
growing density perturbations on length scales larger than the magnetic Jeans
length, $\lambda_B$, and damped oscillations for scales smaller than
$\lambda_B$. For small wavenumbers $k$ (large length scales), we find the
magnetic field-induced density power spectrum generally scales as $k^4$. We
derive the magnetic Jeans length explicitly by including the back--reaction of
the velocity field onto the magnetic field by decomposing the magnetic field
into a force-free background field and perturbations about it. Depending on the
strength of the magnetic field and the ultraviolet cutoff of its spectrum,
structure can be generated on small or intermediate scales early in the history
of the universe. For a present {\it rms} magnetic field of $10^{-10}$ G on
intergalactic scales, we find that perturbations on galactic scales could have
gone non--linear at $z \simeq 6$. Finally, we discuss how primordial magnetic
fields affect scenarios of structure formation with non--baryonic dark matter.

related to the occurrence of a significant merging event in the recent past.
The seven models are: (1) the standard CDM model (SCDM) with $\Omega_0 = 1$,
$\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.5$; (2) a low-density flat model (FL03) with
$\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$; (3) an open model (OP03) with
$\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.75$; (4) a low-density flat model (FL02)

$\Omega_0=0.2$, $\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=1$; (6) a low-density flat model (FL01)
with $\Omega_0=0.1$ and $\Lambda_0=0.9$; (7) an open model (OP01) with
$\Omega_0=0.1$ and $\Lambda_0=0$. We find that the density profiles and
morphologies of clusters depend both on $\Omega_0$ and on $\Lambda_0$. For
$\Lambda_0=0$, these properties are a monotonic function of $\Omega_0$.
Clusters in OP01 have the steepest density profiles, their density contours are
the roundest and show the smallest center shifts. The other extreme case is
SCDM, where clusters show the least steep density profiles and the most
elongated contours. For a given $\Omega_0$ ($<1$), clusters in the flat model
(i.e. with $\Lambda_0=1-\Omega_0$) have flatter density profiles and less
substructures than in the corresponding open model. In particular, our results
show that low-density flat models with $\Omega_0\sim 0.3$, which are currently
considered as a successful alternative to SCDM, can produce a substantial
fraction of clusters with substructures. This is in contrast to the conception
that this kind of models may have serious problem in this aspect.

function, log N-log S, and radio flux distribution starting from radio selected
BL Lacs using a method that does not require any free parameters. Our
hypothesis is at variance with the most common explanation for the existence of
two classes of BL Lacs, namely that X-ray selected objects are viewed
significantly off the beaming axis while radio-selected ones have their jets
more aligned with the line of sight. In this case, in fact, X-ray selected
sources should be intrinsically more numerous than objects selected in the
radio band at a fixed value of some isotropic luminosity such as that of the
diffuse radio emission. While also accounting for most of the properties of BL
Lacs detected in current X-ray surveys, this latter scenario would predict
their radio emission to be dominated by the extended (unbeamed) component, in
contrast with observations. We also address the question of the negative
evolution apparently exhibited by X-ray selected BL Lacs, showing that neither
recognition problems nor a break in the X-ray spectrum are likely to be
responsible for it. Our hypothesis explains in a simple way the bimodal
distribution of BL Lacs in the alpha_ro - alpha_ ox diagram. It also makes
specific predictions for the X-ray, radio, and optical properties of BL Lacs

be a gravitational lens candidate with a separation of 0.47"" between the two
imaged components (A and B). NOT (Nordic Optical Telescope) and HST (Hubble
Space Telescope) studies from 1992 probing primarily the continuum light show
that the amplification of A relative to B is almost achromatic with the
canonical value A:B=4+/-0.1. In this paper we present high-resolution optical
images (FWHM=0.4""-0.5"") from 1993 of the quasar. From our narrow-band CCD
frames centred on the redshifted Ly-alpha/Nv line at 5900 A we find that
A:B=3.85+/-0.2. Our broad-band I images uncontaminated by line-emission are
found to be affected by PSF variation over a range of 20\arcsec. However, by
iteratively determining the PSF from the images themselves we show that the
data can be accounted for by two point sources with A:B=3.35+/-0.2. These
results imply that the continuum intensity ratio has decreased during 1992-1993
and that the amplification of the emission-line regions relative to the
continuum emitting regions is different in the two components (under the
gravitational lens hypothesis). The most conservative interpretation of these
results is that 1208+1011 is a gravitationally lensed quasar in which component
B is being microlensed, but the possibility that 1208+1011 is a binary quasar
is not excluded by the present data.

perturbation schemes using N--body simulations for various power--spectra with
scale--independent indices in the range $-3$ to $+1$. The models have been
evolved deeply into the non--linear regime of structure formation in order to
probe the dynamical and statistical performance of the Lagrangian perturbation
schemes (whose first--order solution contains as a subset the celebrated
``Zel'dovich--approximation'', hereafter ZA). These tests reveal properties of
the approximations at stages beyond the obvious validity of perturbation
theory. Recently, another series of tests of different analytical and
semi--numerical approximations for large--scale structure was conducted with
the result that ZA displays the best dynamical performance in comparison with
the N--body simulations, if the initial data were smoothed before evolving the
model, i.e., a truncated form of ZA (TZA). We show in this contribution that
the excellent performance of TZA can be further improved by going to second
order in the Lagrangian perturbation approach. The truncated second--order
Lagrangian scheme provides a useful improvement over TZA especially for
negative power indices, which suggests it will be very useful for modelling
standard scenarios such as ``Cold--'', ``Hot--'' and ``Mixed--Dark--Matter''.

systematic deviations (0.1-0.2 mag.) from the R^1/4 law. In this paper we show
that the senses and amplitudes of these departures can be naturally accounted
for by a simple distribution function constructed on the basis of statistical
mechanics of violent relaxation. As a consequence, detailed light-profiles can
be used to infer about the central potentials of E galaxies (the only free
shape parameter of our model). Furthermore, the small deviations have recently
been shown to correlate with luminosity, L. This observation entails a slight
breaking of the generally assumed structural homology between E galaxies. Using
our model we parametrize this broken homology by establishing a correlation
between a suitably normalized central potential and luminosity. The
non-homology means that a basic assumption in the interpretation of the
Fundamental Plane (FP) breaks down, and with it the conclusions derived from
it. Instead, by assuming that M/L is independent of luminosity, we derive a
relation akin to the FP directly from our correlation. This implies that the FP
may have a simple stellar dynamical origin. We can reproduce the observed
Carlberg-Kormendy relation for the central phase-space densities (f_c) of E
galaxies of identical structure, f_c = L^-2.35, but non-homology changes it to
a much weaker dependence (f_c = L^-1.5 for constant M/L) which would imply that
the central phase-space densities of ellipticals are comparable to those of
spiral galaxies. Thus dissipationless merging is consistent with the FP,
although HST observations, notably the presence of nuclear embedded disks,
indicate that the assumptions behind our model break down for the nuclei of
faint E galaxies in which dissipative processes seem to be important.

of the standard model explain the stability of the gauge hierarchy. This
ancient and hallowed motivation for weak scale supersymmetry is often quoted,
yet no reliable determination of this upper limit on superpartner masses
exists. In this paper we compute upper bounds on superpartner masses in the
minimal supersymmetric model, and we identify which values of the superpartner
masses correspond to the most natural explanation of the hierarchy stability.
We compare the most natural value of these masses and their upper limits to the
physics reach of current and future colliders. As a result, we find that
supersymmetry could explain weak scale stability naturally even if no
superpartners are discovered at LEP II or the Tevatron (even with the Main
Injector upgrade). However, we find that supersymmetry cannot provide a
complete explanation of weak scale stability, if squarks and gluinos have
masses beyond the physics reach of the LHC. Moreover, in the most natural
scenarios, many sparticles, for example, charginos, squarks, and gluinos, lie
within the physics reach of either LEP II or the Tevatron. Our analysis
determines the most natural value of the chargino (squark) ((gluino)) mass
consistent with current experimental constraints is $\sim$ 50 (250) ((250)) GeV

region of small $x$ and show that this coherent structure can be detected in
associated distributions. For structure functions at small $x$ and at fixed
transverse momentum the angular ordering is masked because of the complete
inclusive cancellations of collinear singularities for \xt0. Therefore, in this
case the dependence on the hard scale is lost and the angular ordered region
becomes equivalent to multi-Regge region in which all transverse momenta are of
the same order. In this limit one derives the BFKL equation. In general such a
complete cancellation does not hold for the associated distributions at small
$x$. The calculation, which requires an analysis without any collinear
approximation, is done by extending to small $x$ the soft gluon factorization
techniques largely uses in the region of large $x$. Since one finds angular
ordering in the both regions of small and large $x$, one can formulate a
unified evolution equation for the structure function, a unified coherent
branching and jet algorithm which allows the calculation of associated
distributions in all $x$ regions. Such a unified formulation valid for all $x$
is presented and compared with usual treatments. In particular we show that the
associated distributions at small $x$ are sensitive to coherence. By replacing
angular ordering with the multi-Regge region one neglects large singular
contributions in the associated distributions.

then there exists a cycle of Fatou components whose boundaries are Jordan
curves. We give examples of critically finite hyperbolic rational maps $f$ with
the property that on the closure of a Fatou component $\Omega$ satisfying
$f(\Omega)=\Omega$, $f|_{\bdry \Omega}$ is not topologically conjugate to the
