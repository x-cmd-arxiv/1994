are presented here and compared with the three previously published objects.
Using a simple power law model with free absorption a wide range of spectral
slopes is found. Objects with emission lines have flatter X-ray spectra than
lineless objects. Indication of spectral curvature within the X-ray band is
found in the sense of a concavity (soft excess) for the flattest spectrum and a
convexity (soft deficiency) for the steepest one. The X-ray spectral shape is
discussed in relation to the overall energy distribution for the six objects.
The results are compared with other samples of blazars. The X-ray spectral
index, alpha_X, is found to be anticorrelated with the broad band spectral
index alpha_RO and with bolometric luminosity and redshift. It is suggested
that the different spectra of quasar-like and BL Lac-like blazars represent
extremes in a continuous distribution rather than two distinct populations.

the reddening is consistent with the high extinction ($A_V\simeq30\,$mag.) that
has been inferred for AX~1805.7$-$2025. From the absence of CO band absorption,
we infer that the spectral type of this star is earlier than late~G/early~K.
The large extinction probably arises in a molecular cloud located at a distance
of 6$\,$kpc, which means that the star, just like AX~1805.7$-$2025, is in or
behind this cloud. This implies that the star is a supergiant. Since
supergiants are rare, a chance coincidence with the compact radio core is very
unlikely. To our knowledge, there are only three other examples of luminous
stars embedded in non-thermal radio nebulae, SS~433, \mbox{Cir X-1} and

vacancy domains tend to be faceted: the external driving force causes large
domains to move much more quickly than small ones, producing exponential domain
growth. At higher vacancy concentrations and temperatures, even small domains
have rough boundaries: velocity differences between domains are smaller, and
modest simulation times produce an average domain length scale which roughly
follows $L \sim t^{\zeta}$, where $\zeta$ varies from near .55 at 50% filling
to near .75 at 70% filling. This growth is faster than the $t^{1/3}$ behavior
of a standard conserved order parameter Ising model. Some runs may be
approaching a scaling regime. At low fields and early times, fast growth is
delayed until the characteristic domain size reaches a crossover length which
follows $L_{cross} \propto E^{-\beta}$. Rough numerical estimates give $\beta=

one unstable mode and thus represents a critical nucleus for thermally
activated magnetization reversal in effectively one-dimensional systems. The
soliton-soliton pair is stable for small external fields but becomes unstable
for large magnetic fields. From the detailed expression of this instability

time dependent coercivity of elongated particles as used in magnetic recording
media. The energy barrier that has to be overcome by thermal fluctuations
corresponds to a soliton-antisoliton pair whose size depends on the external
field. In contrast to other models of first order phase transitions such as the
phi^4 model, an analytical expression for this energy barrier is found for all
values of the external field. The magnetization reversal rate is calculated
using a functional Fokker-Planck description of the stochastic magnetization
dynamics. Analytical results are obtained in the limits of small fields and
fields close to the anisotropy field. In the former case the hard-axis
anisotropy becomes effectively strong and the magnetization reversal rate is
shown to reduce to the nucleation rate of soliton-antisoliton pairs in the
overdamped double sine-Gordon model. The present theory therefore includes the
nucleation rate of soliton-antisoliton pairs in the double sine-Gordon chain as
a special case. These results demonstrate that for elongated particles, the

derivation of the real time formalism of thermal field theory. It is shown
that, contrary to popular belief, the generating functional of time ordered
Green functions does not factorise. When no asymptotic condition is applied to
the real time formalism, we find that the normal two component Feynman rules
arises naturally. In addition, the extra Feynman rule that is applied when
calculating vacuum diagrams is simply derived. We also clear up any doubts
regarding the equivalence of the real and imaginary time formalisms. Finally,
we consider these results in the case of the new real time contour.

certain additional hypotheses, this N=1 structure admits an N=2 extension. If
this is the case, G is said to possess an N=2 structure. It is also known that
an N=2 structure on a self-dual Lie algebra G is equivalent to a vector space
