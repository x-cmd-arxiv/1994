shore cable, the underwater junction box, and an environmental module was
accomplished in December, 1993. One optical module string was also deployed and
operated, logging data for about 10 hours. The underwater cable was connected
to the shore station where we were able to successfully exercise system
controls and log further environmental data. After this time, water leaking
into the electronics control module for the deployed string disabled the string
electrical system. The acquired data are consistent with the expected rate of
downgoing muons, and our ability to reconstruct muons was demonstrated. The
measured acoustical backgrounds are consistent with expectation, which should
allow acoustical detection of nearby PeV particle cascades. The disabled string
has been recovered and is undergoing repairs ashore. We have identified the
source of the water leak and implemented additional testing and QC procedures
to ensure no repetition in our next deployment. We will be ready to deploy
three strings and begin continuous data taking in 1995.

Omega is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the bias parameter. On
small scales, the distortion is dominated by the random velocity dispersion in

sigma_v. Tests on N-body simulations show that this model recovers beta quite
accurately on the scales accessible to the existing IRAS redshift surveys.

remedy in the ideas on ``forms of relativistic dynamics'' by Dirac. Some
aspects of Dirac's theory are generalized to all finite-dimensional first-class

group and the algebra of its generators as used by Dirac by a canonical group
of symmetries and by an algebra of elementary perennials. A number of insights
is gained; the following are the main results. First, conditions are revealed
under which the time evolution of the ordinary quantum mechanics, or a
generalization of it, can be constructed. The construction uses a kind of gauge
and time choice and it is described in detail. Second, the theory is structured
so that the quantum mechanics resulting from different choices of gauge and
time are compatible. Third, a practical way is presented of how a broad class

basic axioms of Hopf algebras and noncommutative differential geometry. The
space of generalized derivations on a Hopf algebra of functions is presented
via the smash product, and used to define and discuss quantum Lie algebras and
their properties. The Cartan calculus of the exterior derivative, Lie
derivative, and inner derivation is found for both the universal and general
differential calculi of an arbitrary Hopf algebra, and, by restricting to the
quasitriangular case and using the numerical R-matrix formalism, the
aforementioned structures for quantum groups are determined.

(Abelian graphs), both directed and undirected. The problem turns out to be
closely related to the problem of finding efficient lattice coverings of
Euclidean space by shapes such as octahedra and tetrahedra; we exploit this
relationship in both directions. In particular, we find the largest Abelian
graphs with 2 generators (dimensions) and a given diameter. (The results for 2
generators are not new; they are given in the literature of distributed loop
networks.) We find an undirected Abelian graph with 3 generators and a given
diameter which we conjecture to be as large as possible; for the directed case,
we obtain partial results, which lead to unusual lattice coverings of 3-space.
We discuss the asymptotic behavior of the problem for large numbers of
generators. The graphs obtained here are substantially better than traditional
toroidal meshes, but, in the simpler undirected cases, retain certain desirable
features such as good routing algorithms, easy constructibility, and the
ability to host mesh-connected numerical algorithms without any increase in
communication times.

equations for definite sums of hypergeometric terms $F(n,k)$ is extended to
certain nonhypergeometric terms. An expression $F(n,k)$ is called a
hypergeometric term if both $F(n+1,k)/F(n,k)$ and $F(n,k+1)/F(n,k)$ are
rational functions. Typical examples are ratios of products of exponentials,
factorials, $\Gamma$ function terms, bin omial coefficients, and Pochhammer
symbols that are integer-linear with respect to $n$ and $k$ in their arguments.
  We consider the more general case of ratios of products of exponentials,
factorials, $\Gamma$ function terms, binomial coefficients, and Pochhammer
symbols that are rational-linear with respect to $n$ and $k$ in their
arguments, and present an extended version of Zeilberger's algorithm for this
case, using an extended version of Gosper's algorithm for indefinite summation.
  In a similar way the Wilf-Zeilberger method of rational function
certification of integer-linear hypergeometric identities is extended to
rational-linear hypergeometric identities.

  The REDUCE package ZEILBERG is a careful implementation of the Gosper and

terms, respectively. An expression $a_k$ is called a {\sl hypergeometric term}
(or {\sl closed form}), if $a_{k}/a_{k-1}$ is a rational function with respect
to $k$. Typical hypergeometric terms are ratios of products of powers,
factorials, $\Gamma$ function terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted
factorials (Pochhammer symbols) that are integer-linear in their arguments.

the standard pion excess model. In particular there is no discrepancy between
the EMC data and our results in the x-region which was expected to be most
sensitive to the pion.
