  Replaced by the complete document now that 650kb is no longer a large file",,,,"astro-ph",,"  One of the main challenges in cosmology is to quantify how small density
fluctuations at the recombination epoch z around 1000 evolved into the galaxies
and the large-scale structure we observe in the universe today. This thesis
discusses ways of probing the intermediate epoch, focusing on the thermal
history. The main emphasis is on the role played by non-linear feedback, where
a small fraction of matter forming luminous objects can inject enough energy
into the inter-galactic medium to radically alter subsequent events. Chapter 2,
""A Cosmology Primer"", provides a 60-page introduction to cosmology that may be
useful for the reader with a general physics background.

maps is presented and applied to the 2 year COBE data, yielding a power
spectrum that is consistent with a standard n=1, Q=20 micro-Kelvin model. By
using weight functions that fall off smoothly near the galactic cut, it is
found that the spectral resolution \Delta l can be more than doubled at l=15
and more than tripled at l=20 compared to simply using galaxy-cut spherical
harmonics. For a future high-resolution experiment with reasonable sky
coverage, the resolution around the CDM Doppler peaks would be enhanced by a
factor of about 100, down to \Delta l\approx 1, thus allowing spectral features
such as the locations of the peaks to be determined with great accuracy. The
reason that the improvement is so large is basically that functions with a
sharp edge at the galaxy cut exhibit considerable ""ringing"" in the Fourier
domain, whereas smooth functions do not. The method presented here is
applicable to any survey geometry, chopping strategy and exposure pattern
whatsoever. The so called signal-to-noise eigenfunction technique is found to
be a special case, corresponding to ignoring the width of the window functions.

extended so that it becomes applicable to some parametrized systems that do not
admit a global transversal surface. A simple completely solvable toy system is
studied that admits a pair of maximal transversal surfaces intersecting all
orbits. The corresponding two quantum mechanics are constructed. The similarity
of the canonical group actions in the classical phase spaces on the one hand
and in the quantum Hilbert spaces on the other hand suggests how the two
Hilbert spaces are to be pasted together. The resulting quantum theory is
checked to be equivalent to that constructed directly by means of Dirac's
operator constraint method. The complete system of partial Hamiltonians for any
of the two transversal surfaces is chosen and the quantum Schr\""{o}dinger or
Heisenberg pictures of time evolution are constructed.

the performance of the new algorithm at the field-driven first-order phase
transitions between the two ordered phases we carefully analyze the
autocorrelations of the Monte Carlo process. Compared with standard
multicanonical simulations a real-time improvement of about one order of
magnitude is established. The interface tension between the two ordered phases
is extracted from high-statistics histograms of the magnetization applying
histogram reweighting techniques.

These two forms are related to two families of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA)
systems, which are argued to be associated with the $\hat{\phi}_{1,3}^{\rm

Certain other q-series identities and TBA systems are also discussed, as well
as a possible representation-theoretical consequence of our results, based on

  Vladimir, May, 1994",,,"SMI-15-94","hep-th hep-ph",,"  Recently E.Verlinde and H.Verlinde have suggested an effective
two-dimensional theory describing the high-energy scattering in QCD. In this
report we attempt to clarify some issues of this suggestion. We consider {\it
anisotropic asymptotics} of correlation functions for scalar and gauge theories
in four dimensions. Anisotropic asymptotics describe behaviour of correlation
functions when some components of coordinates are large as compare with others
components. It is occurred that (2+2) anisotropic asymptotics for 4-points
functions are related with the well known Regge regime of scattering
amplitudes. We study an expansion of correlation functions with respect to the
rescaling parameter $\lambda$ over a part of variables (anisotropic
$\lambda$-expansion). An effective theory describing the anisotropic limit of
free scalar field contains two 2 dim conformal theories. One of them is a
conformal theory in configuration space and another one is a conformal theory
in momentum space. In some special cases ,in particular for the Wilson line
correlators in gauge theories, the leading term of the anisotropic expansion
involves only one of the conformal theories and it can be described by an
effective theory with an action being a dimensional reduction of the original
action.
