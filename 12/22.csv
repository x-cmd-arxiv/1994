coupled from accreting matter to closed field lines where it forms a pair gas.
This magnetically confined pair gas radiates roughly a black body spectrum with

the energy and angular distribution of scattered photons. The resultant photon
spectra are compared with the nonrelativistic diffusion treatment of Sunyaev

corrections proposed by Titarchuk. We calculate allowed pair-balanced states of
thermal plasmas with no pair escape which include bremsstrahlung and internal
soft photons. The results are presented in the spectral index/compactness
plane, and can be directly compared with observations of spectra from AGNs and
Galactic black hole candidates. By comparing with X-ray spectral indices of
Seyfert AGNs and compactnesses inferred from X-ray variability data, we find
that the allowed solutions for pair equilibrium plasma imply that the
temperatures of Seyfert galaxies are $\lesssim 300$ keV. This prediction can be
tested with more sensitive gamma-ray observations of Seyfert galaxies. We find
that if the X-ray variability time scale gives an accurate measure of the
compactness, pair-dominated solutions are inconsistent with the data.

understanding the strong coupling regime. These {\it solitonic} solutions are
non-singular field configurations which solve the empty-space low-energy field
equations (generalized, whenever possible, to all orders in $\alpha'$), carry a
non-vanishing topological ""magnetic"" charge and are stabilized by a topological
conservation law. They are compared and contrasted with the {\it elementary}
solutions which are singular solutions of the field equations with a
$\sigma$-model source term and carry a non-vanishing Noether ""electric"" charge.
In both cases, the solutions of most interest are those which preserve half the
spacetime supersymmetries and saturate a Bogomol'nyi bound. They typically
arise as the extreme mass=charge limit of more general two-parameter solutions
with event horizons. We also describe the theory {\it dual} to the fundamental
string for which the roles of elementary and soliton solutions are
interchanged. In ten spacetime dimensions, this dual theory is a superfivebrane
and this gives rise to a string/fivebrane duality conjecture according to which
the fivebrane may be regarded as fundamental in its own right, with the
strongly coupled string corresponding to the weakly coupled fivebrane and
vice-versa. After compactification to four spacetime dimensions, the fivebrane
appears as a magnetic monopole or a dual string according as it wraps around
five or four of the compactified dimensions. This gives rise to a
four-dimensional string/string duality conjecture which subsumes a
Montonen-Olive type duality in that the magnetic monopoles of the fundamental
string correspond to the electric winding states of the dual string. This leads
to a {\it duality of dualities} whereby under string/string duality the the
strong/weak coupling $S$-duality trades places with the minimum/maximum length
$T$-duality. Since these magnetic monopoles are extreme black holes, a
prediction of $S$-duality is that the corresponding electric massive states of
the fundamental string are also extreme black holes.
