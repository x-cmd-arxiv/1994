Pole during the 93-94 austral summer. Each observation employed a 3$^{\circ}$
peak to peak sinusoidal, single difference chop and consisted of a
$20^{\circ}\times 1^{\circ}$ strip on the sky near our SP91 observations. The
first observation used a Q-band receiver which operates in 3 bands between 38
and 45 GHz with a $1^{\circ}$ to $1_{\cdot}^{\circ }15$ FWHM beam. The second
observation overlapped the first observation and used a Ka-band receiver which
operates in 4 bands between 26 and 36 GHz with a $1_{\cdot}^{\circ}25$ to
$1_{\cdot}^{\circ}7$ FWHM beam. Significant correlated structure is observed in
all bands for each observation. The spectrum of the structure is consistent
with a CMB spectrum; however, the data do not discriminate against flat or
inverted spectrum point sources. The root mean square amplitude ($\pm 1\sigma$)
of the combined (Ka+Q) data is $\Delta T_{rms}=42.0_{-6.8}^{+15.8}$ $\mu$K in a
band of multipoles between $\ell=68^{+38}_{-32}$. A band power estimate of the
CMB power spectrum, $C_\ell$, gives $\left\langle \frac{C_\ell \ell

power estimates for the seperate Ka and Q-band results are larger than but
consistent with the band power estimate of the combined Ka-band SP91 results.

  (send postal address) by email to wnb@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk, MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We systematically investigate the effects of high supernova kick velocities
on the orbital parameters of post-supernova neutron-star binaries. Using Monte-
Carlo simulations, we determine the post-supernova distributions of orbital
parameters for progeneitors of HMXBs and LMXBs. With the recent distribution of
pulsar birth velocities by Lyne & Lorimer (1994), only about 27% of massive
systems remain bound after the supernova, of which about 26% immediately
experience dynamical mass transfer and possibly merge to become Thorne-Zytkow
objects. The correlations between various orbital parameters can be compared
with observational samples to yield information about supernova kick velocities
and pre-supernova orbital-period distributions. After the supernova, the spins
of most stars in massive systems have large inclinations with respect to their
orbital axes, and a significant fraction of systems (about 20%) contain stars
with retrograde spins. In the case of low-mass companions, we find that about
19% of systems remain bound after the supernova, of which about 57% experience
immediate dynamical mass transfer. There is a tight correlation between the
eccentricity and the post-supernova orbital period in LMXB progeneitors. All
LMXBs with post-supernova periods longer than a few days initially have large
eccentricities (e.g. Cir X-1 is discussed in this context). We use the results
of these calculations to simulate the sky distributions of HMXBs and LMXBs. The
simulated distributions agree with observed samples. Most importantly, the
distribution of Galactic LMXBs is consistent with an ordinary Galactic disk
population which has been widened because of large supernova kicks and does not
require a special population of progenitors.

N-body simulations of cosmological density fields we show that the velocity
field traced by clusters is highly non-linear on small scales (r < 10 h^-1
Mpc), mostly due to strong infall into superclusters. The transverse and line
of sight velocity correlation functions relevant to likelihood analysis deviate
significantly from the linear theory values. Unfortunately, the sparseness of
cluster samples means that they are not amenable to any rigorous smoothing
procedure to rectify this. We are forced instead to remove close pairs of
clusters which would contribute disproportionately to the likelihood. This
reduces the size still further of the small samples of observed clusters
available to us, forcing us into the conclusion that using straightfoward
linear theory covariance analysis on clusters is unpromising. Nevertheless we
apply the technique to two sets of observational data and find marginal
evidence for more power in the mass density field than standard CDM. The
normalisation is consistent with \Omega^{0.6}\sigma_{8} \sim 0.7 for both data

illustrated in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. Possible applications of this

proceeds through the conventional Drell--Yan mechanism $q \bar{q} \rightarrow

a quark--lepton contact interaction {\it via} a $q l \phi$ Yukawa coupling,
where $\phi$ is a scalar. Theories with scalar leptoquarks and $R$--parity
violating SUSY models are the most important examples of such extensions. These
Yukawa couplings induce a different dynamical configuration compared to the SM

thus offer the possibility of being identifiable upon imposition of suitable
kinematic cuts. We discuss these effects in the context of the dilepton

of the calculus of differential forms on a smooth manifold. It supplies A with
a structure on which dynamics and field theory can be formulated to some extent
in very much the same way we are used to from the geometrical arena underlying
classical physical theories and models. In previous work, certain differential
calculi on a commutative algebra exhibited relations with lattice structures,
stochastics, and parametrized quantum theories. This motivated the present
systematic investigation of differential calculi on commutative and associative
algebras. Various results about their structure are obtained. In particular, it
is shown that there is a correspondence between first order differential
calculi on such an algebra and commutative and associative products in the
space of 1-forms. An example of such a product is provided by the Ito calculus
of stochastic differentials.
  For the case where the algebra A is freely generated by `coordinates' x^i,
i=1,...,n, we study calculi for which the differentials dx^i constitute a basis
of the space of 1-forms (as a left A-module). These may be regarded as
`deformations' of the ordinary differential calculus on R^n. For n < 4 a
classification of all (orbits under the general linear group of) such calculi
with `constant structure functions' is presented. We analyse whether these
calculi are reducible (i.e., a skew tensor product of lower-dimensional
calculi) or whether they are the extension (as defined in this article) of a
one dimension lower calculus. Furthermore, generalizations to arbitrary n are
obtained for all these calculi.

inequivalent mutant knots and links. In an attempt to distinguish these knots
and links, we study Murakami (symmetrized version) $r$-strand composite braids.
Salient features of the theory of such composite braids are presented.
Representations of generators for these braids are obtained by exploiting
properties of Hilbert spaces associated with the correlators of Wess-Zumino
conformal field theories. The $r$-composite invariants for the knots are given
by the sum of elementary Chern-Simons invariants associated with the
irreducible representations in the product of $r$ representations (allowed by
the fusion rules of the corresponding Wess-Zumino conformal field theory)
placed on the $r$ individual strands of the composite braid. On the other hand,
composite invariants for links are given by a weighted sum of elementary
multicoloured Chern-Simons invariants. Some mutant links can be distinguished
through the composite invariants, but mutant knots do not share this property.
The results, though developed in detail within the framework of $SU(2)$
Chern-Simons theory are valid for any other non-abelian gauge group.

"math/9412233","Yair Minsky","Mikhail Lyubich, Yair Minsky","Laminations in holomorphic dynamics",,,,"Stony Brook IMS 1994/20","math.DS",,"  We suggest a way to associate to a rational map of the Riemann sphere a three
dimensional object called a hyperbolic orbifold 3-lamination. The relation of
this object to the map is analogous to the relation of a hyperbolic 3-manifold
to a Kleinian group. In order to construct the 3-lamination we analyze the
natural extension of a rational map and the complex affine structure on the
canonical 2-dimensional leaf space contained in it. In this paper the
construction is carried out in full for post-critically finite maps. We show
that the corresponding laminations have a compact convex core. As a first
application we give a three-dimensional proof of Thurston's rigidity for
post-critically finite mappings, via the ""lamination extension"" of the proofs
of the Mostow and Marden rigidity and isomorphism theorems for hyperbolic
3-manifolds. An Ahlfors-type argument for zero measure of the Julia set is
applied along the way. This approach also provides a new point of view on the
Lattes deformable examples.
