pinned by a directed percolation (DP) cluster for $d = 1$, or a directed

critical exponents of the growth process. For the case of $(1+1)$ dimensions,
the theory predicts that the roughness exponent $\alpha$ is given by $\alpha =
\nu_{\perp} / \nu_{\parallel}$, where $\nu_{\perp}$ and $\nu_{\parallel}$ are
the exponents governing the divergence of perpendicular and parallel
correlation lengths of the DP incipient infinite cluster. The theory also
predicts that the dynamical exponent $z$ equals the exponent $d_{\rm min}$
characterizing the scaling of the shortest path on a isotropic percolation
cluster. The exponent $\alpha$ decreases monotonically with $d$ but does not
seem to approach zero for any dimension calculated ($d \le 6$), suggesting that
the DPD model has no upper critical dimension for the static exponents. On the
other hand, $z$ appears to approach $2$ as $d \rightarrow 6$, as expected by
the result $z = d_{\rm min}$, suggesting that $d_c = 6$ for the dynamics. We
also perform a set of imbibition experiments, in both $(1+1)$ and $(2+1)$

in an anomaly-cancellation mode in the effective low-energy supergravity. The
massless antisymmetric tensor plays an important r\^ole in this mechanism and
the choice of its supersymmetric description, using either a chiral or a linear
multiplet, appears to introduce significant conceptual and practical
differences at the string loop level. This paper reviews the construction of
loop-corrected string effective supergravities with the dilaton and
antisymmetric tensor embedded in a linear multiplet. Using anomaly cancellation
and the linear multiplet allows to obtain an all-order renormalization-group
invariant effective lagrangian for a pure gauge sector with field-dependent
gauge coupling constant.

Regge's discrete formulation of gravity. The nature of exact continuous lattice
diffeomorphisms and the implications for a regularized gravitational measure
are examined. After introducing a massless scalar field coupled to the edge
lengths, the scalar functional integral is performed exactly on a finite
lattice, and the ensuing change in the measure is determined. It is found that
the renormalization of the cosmological constant due to the scalar field
fluctuations vanishes identically in one dimension. A simple decimation
renormalization group transformation is performed on the partition function and
the results are compared with the exact solution. Finally the properties of the
spectrum of the scalar Laplacian are compared with results obtained for a
Poissonian distribution of edge lengths.

  orbitals","24 pages, RevTex file, 5 figures available upon request",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.52.1640",,"mtrl-th cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  An energy functional for orbital based $O(N)$ calculations is proposed, which
depends on a number of non orthogonal, localized orbitals larger than the
number of occupied states in the system, and on a parameter, the electronic
chemical potential, determining the number of electrons. We show that the
minimization of the functional with respect to overlapping localized orbitals
can be performed so as to attain directly the ground state energy, without
being trapped at local minima. The present approach overcomes the multiple
minima problem present within the original formulation of orbital based $O(N)$
methods; it therefore makes it possible to perform $O(N)$ calculations for an
arbitrary system, without including any information about the system bonding
properties in the construction of the input wavefunctions. Furthermore, while
retaining the same computational cost as the original approach, our formulation
allows one to improve the variational estimate of the ground state energy, and
the energy conservation during a molecular dynamics run. Several numerical
examples for surfaces, bulk systems and clusters are presented and discussed.

susceptibility at finite temperature, agreeing with the PCAC expectation at low
temperature and enhanced suppression for temperatures at and above the
deconfinement transition. For temperatures up to about 334 MeV, the topological
charge correlation agrees well with a single instanton profile, though the size
parameter seems to change across the phase transition. The screening wave
functions for the pion and the rho become slightly more compact at higher
temperatures. Lattice cooling shows no contribution from the instantons to the
screening wave functions at temperatures above the phase transition.

antineutrino scattering using a relativistic meson-nucleon model. We examine
how nuclear-structure effects, such as relativistic random-phase-approximation
(RPA) corrections and momentum-dependent nucleon self-energies, influence the
extraction of the axial form factor of the nucleon. RPA corrections are
important only at low-momentum transfers. In contrast, the momentum dependence
of the relativistic self-energies changes appreciably the value of the
axial-mass parameter, $M_A$, extracted from dipole fits to the axial form
factor. Using Brookhaven's experimental neutrino spectrum we estimate the
sensitivity of M$_A$ to various relativistic nuclear-structure effects.
