processing systems, in particular for those systems that aim at a wide coverage
of domains. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze structures of
Japanese compound nouns by using both word collocations statistics and a
thesaurus. An experiment is conducted with 160,000 word collocations to analyze
compound nouns of with an average length of 4.9 characters. The accuracy of
this method is about 80%.

second derivatives of eigenvalues with respect to a magnetic flux) for a
particle moving in a white-noise random potential.
  We find that the Zakrzewski-Delande conjecture is still valid even if the
lowest weak localization corrections are taken into account. The ratio of mean
level curvature modulus to mean dissipative conductance is proved to be
universal and equal to $2\pi$ in agreement with available numerical data.
