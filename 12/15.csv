lensing is studied in terms of the accuracy of their reproduction of the total
cluster mass as a function of distance from the cluster center. To do so, a
variety of reconstruction algorithms is applied to synthetic lensing data
created using a sample of 60 numerically modeled clusters, and the mass
reconstruction is compared to the known deflector mass. The results can be
summarized as follows: (1) Reconstruction algorithms which require integrations
extending over the entire real plane yield unreliable results, because they
give rise to boundary effects which are hard to control; mass overestimates are
more likely and more substantial in this case than underestimates. (2)
Reconstruction techniques which avoid these boundary effects yield reliable
lower bounds to the cluster mass. The tightness of such bounds depends on the
size of the field, which can be extended synthetically to improve the results
considerably. For the sample of numerical cluster models, the best lower
bounds, achieved by combining synthetic field extension with non-linear,
finite-field reconstruction, decline from 100% to 80% of the true cluster mass
going from the cluster center to an angular distance of 2.5'. The 80% error
bars of the lower mass bounds are +/- 10% to 15%.

wormholes when the strong energy condition ($\gamma>2/3$) is satisfied, we are
able to simplify the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation by using an equivalent
scalar potential which is a function of the scale factor. Such wormholes are
found to be consistent with the Hawking-Page (HP) conjecture for quantum
wormholes as solutions of the WDW equation. In addition to the CM type
wormholes, for a scalar field realization of the potential in the WDW equation
we also obtain quantum wormholes when the strong energy condition is violated.
This violation can be up to an arbitrary large distance from the wormhole
throat, before the violation eventually has to be relaxed in order to have a
flat Euclidean space time. These results give support to the claim of HP that
wormhole solutions are a fairly general property of the WDW equation. However,
by allowing such solutions one might be precluding other more important
properties such as a Lorentzian behaviour and a possible inflationary earlier
stage of our universe.

contribution to DCX of the conventional mechanism, with two quasielastic SCX
steps decreases very fast as a function of the energy and reaches very low
values at energies above 0.7 GeV. This opens the opportunity of having sizeable
contributions of exotic mechanisms that are negligible at the delta resonance
energies.

states in cylindrical linear cellular automata. The time evolutions are
described with matrices. The eigenvalue analysis is applied to obtain the
maximum values of period and relaxation. The translational invariance
suppresses the maximum period and relaxation.

formalism. It is shown that it admits the solutions expressed by the Casorati
determinant whose entries are given by the discrete Bessel function. Moreover,
based on the observation that these discrete Bessel functions are transformed
to the $q$-Bessel functions by a simple variable transformation, we present a
$q$-difference analogue of the Painlev\'e III equation.

show that these flows are gradient with respect to some indefinite symmetric
flat metric arising in the Hamiltonian theory of the Whitham equations. The
functions generating these flows are conserved quantities for all the equations
simultaneously. We show that for 1+1 systems these flows can be imbedded in a
larger system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations with a rational
right-hand side. Finally these flows are used to give a complete description of
the moduli space of algebraic Riemann surfaces corresponding to periodic
solutions of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation.
