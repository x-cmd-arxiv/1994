random Heisenberg ferromagnet. It is shown that if the specific heat critical
exponent of the pure system is positive, the traditional renormalization group
(RG) flows at dimensions $D=4-\e$, which are usually considered as describing
the disorder-induced universal critical behavior, are {\it unstable} with
respect to replica symmetry breaking (RSB) potentials as found in spin glasses.
It is demonstrated that the RG flows involving RSB potentials lead to fixed
points which have the structure known as the 1 step RSB, and there exists a
whole spectrum of such fixed points. It is argued that spontaneous RSB can
occur due to the interactions of the fluctuating fields with the local
non-perturbative degrees of freedom coming from the multiple local minima
solutions of the mean-field equations. However, it is not clear whether or not
RSB occurs for infinitesimally weak disorder. Physical consequences of these
conclusions are discussed.
