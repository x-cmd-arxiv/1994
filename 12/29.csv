$r_0$ is of order $30$ kpc, then the potential due to the interaction of known
neutrinos in the halos of galaxies can explain the flat rotation curves of
galaxies. The results are based on a physical linear approximation to the NGT
field equations and they are consistent with equivalence principle
observations, other solar system gravitational experiments and the binary

is due to the global gauge anomalies from some subgroups of SO(10) in a
fundamental spinor representation such that the ill-defined 'large' gauge
transformations in the subgroup cannot be unwrapped in SO(10) in the quantum
theory as we noted$^1$. A similar result related to left-right symmetric models

The traces of these quantum monodromy matrices, which will be called as ``${\bf

around $\lambda = \infty$ generates an infinite set of commuting Hamiltonians
of the quantum KdV system. The ${\bf T}$-operators can be viewed as the
continuous field theory versions of the commuting transfer-matrices of
integrable lattice theory. In particular, we show that for the values
$c=1-3{{(2n+1)^2}\over {2n+3}} , n=1,2,3,... $of the Virasoro central charge
the eigenvalues of the ${\bf T}$-operators satisfy a closed system of
functional equations sufficient for determining the spectrum. For the
ground-state eigenvalue these functional equations are equivalent to those of
massless Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for the minimal conformal field theory
${\cal M}_{2,2n+3}$; in general they provide a way to generalize the technique
of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to the excited states. We discuss a
generalization of our approach to the cases of massive field theories obtained
by perturbing these Conformal Field Theories with the operator $\Phi_{1,3}$.
The relation of these ${\bf T}$-operators to the boundary states is also
briefly described.

This part is a simplification of the work of Feigin and Fuks (we correct a
mistake in their patterns in the case III_+), Rocha-Charidi and some new ideas
which yield a simplification of the original papers. In the second part we
define (free) vertex operators as unbounded Hilbert space operators, acting on
Fock spaces, which are Virasoro modules. We prove several properties of these
operators: under appropriate conditions vertex operators are densely defined,
not closable operators. Radially ordered products of vertex operators exists on
a dense subset. We prove commutation relations between vertex operators and
elements of the Virasoro algebra. Next we define, following the (non rigouros)
work of G. Felder, integrated vertex operators and prove that these operators
resemble the properties of the not integrated vertex operators. Special
integrated vertex operators can be identified with conformal fields and a
Virasoro invariant subspace of Fock space can be identified with the physical
Hilbert space for the conformal theory.
