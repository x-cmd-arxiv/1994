classical physics and in the quantum world. After briefly reviewing the
classical principles of equivalence (weak (WEP), Einstein (EEP), strong (SEP)),
I pass to a presentation of several equivalence statements in nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics and for quantum field vacuum states. It is suggested that a
reasonable type of preferred quantum field vacua may be considered: those
possessing stationary spectra of their vacuum fluctuations with respect to
accelerated classical trajectories

CONTINUUM running coupling and (b) globally parameterizing this coupling to
interpolate between 2- (or higher-) loop QCD in the UV and the flux tube
prediction in the IR, we can perfectly fit lattice data for the potential down
to ONE lattice spacing and at the same time extract the running coupling to
high precision. This allows us to quantitatively check the accuracy of 2-loop
evolution, compare with the Lepage-Mackenzie estimate of the coupling extracted
from the plaquette, and determine the scale $r_0$ ten times more accurately
than previously possible. For pure SU(3) we find that the coupling scales on
the percent level for $\beta \geq 6$.

The theory respects the
maximal abelian family symmetries which are spontaneously broken down at a
large scale. We find that quark mixing can be well described in this theory.
Some concrete models are constructed. The crucial point for model building is
to introduce some new particles which are SU(2) gauge singlets and carry -1/3
electric charge. The approximate family symmetries in our low energy effective
theory are naturally achieved. Some interesting phenomena in the effective
theory, especially with two Higgs-doublets, are discussed.

schemes which we call ``random $k$-sets designs''. In these designs, the pools
in which any clone occurs are equally likely to be any possible selection of
$k$ from the $v$ pools. The values of $k$ and $v$ can be chosen to optimize
desirable properties. Random $k$-sets designs have substantial advantages over
alternative pooling schemes: they are efficient, flexible, easy to specify,
require fewer pools, and have error-correcting and error-detecting
capabilities. In addition, screening can often be achieved in only one pass,
thus facilitating automation. For design comparison, we assume a binomial
distribution for the number of ``positive'' clones, with parameters $n$, the
number of clones, and $c$, the coverage. We propose the expected number of {\em
resolved positive} clones---clones which are definitely positive based upon the
pool assays---as a criterion for the efficiency of a pooling design. We
determine the value of $k$ which is optimal, with respect to this criterion, as
a function of $v$, $n$ and $c$. We also describe superior $k$-sets designs
called $k$-sets packing designs. As an illustration, we discuss a robotically
implemented design for a 2.5-fold-coverage, human chromosome 16 YAC library of
$n=1,298$ clones. We also estimate the probability each clone is positive,
given the pool-assay data and a model for experimental errors.
