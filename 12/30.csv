theories by investigating the structure in the m's for each multipole of the
cosmic radiation temperature anisotropies. We prove that Gaussian theories are
(nearly) the only theories which treat all the m's equally. Hence we introduce
a set of invariant measures of ``m-preference'' to be seen as non-Gaussianity
indicators. We then derive the distribution function for the quadrupole
``m-preference'' measure in Gaussian theories. A class of physically motivated
toy non Gaussian theories is introduced as an example. We show how the
quadrupole m-structure is crucial in reducing the confusion between these
theories and Gaussian theories.

determine the magnetic susceptibility of a cluster ensemble of Langevin

smooth $V$, our results reproduce and clarify an algebraic solution of the $V$
