nice schemes, then $Rf_*$ has a right adjoint, which is given as tensor product
with the relative canonical bundle. The original proof was by patching local
data. Deligne proved the existence of the adjoint by a global argument, and
Verdier showed that this global adjoint may be computed locally.
  In this article we show that the existence of the adjoint is an immediate
consequence of Brown's representability theorem. It follows almost as
immediately, by ``smashing'' arguments, that the adjoint is given by tensor
product with a dualising complex. Verdier's base change theorem is an immediate

$g(\rho(P))^2 + g'(\rho'({\cal{O}}))^2$, where the matrix representation of the
puncture operator $P$ and the one of a scaling operator ${\cal{O}}$ are denoted
by $\rho(P)$ and $\rho'({\cal{O}})$ respectively. We rewrite the modified
models as effective theories of baby universes. We find an upper bound for the
gravitational dimension of ${\cal{O}}$ under which we can fine tune the
coupling constants to obtain new critical behaviors in the continuum limit. The
simultaneous tuning of $g$ and $g'$ is possible if the representations
$\rho(P)$ and $\rho'({\cal{O}})$ are chosen so that the non-diagonal elements
of the mass matrix of the effective theory vanish.

"math/9412203",,"Amnon Rosenmann","When Schrier transversals grow wild","LaTex, 12 pages, no figures",,,"MAGNUS preprint #94-12-28A","math.GR",,"  Schreier formula for the rank of a subgroup of finite index of a finitely
generated free group $F$ is generalized to an arbitrary (even infinitely
generated) subgroup $H$ through the Schreier transversals of $H$ in $F$. The
rank formula may also be expressed in terms of the cogrowth of $H$. We
introduce the rank-growth function $rk_H(i)$ of a subgroup $H$ of a finitely
generated free group $F$. $rk_H(i)$ is defined to be the rank of the subgroup
of $H$ generated by elements of length less than or equal to $i$ (with respect
to the generators of $F$), and it equals the rank of the fundamental group of
the subgraph of the cosets graph of $H$, which consists of the paths starting
at $1$ that are of length $\leq i$. When $H$ is supnormal, i.e. contains a
non-trivial normal subgroup of $F$, we show that its rank-growth is equivalent
to the cogrowth of $H$. A special case of this is the known result that a
supnormal subgroup of $F$ is of finite index if and only if it is finitely
generated. In particular, when $H$ is normal then the growth of the group
$G=F/H$ is equivalent to the rank-growth of $H$. A Schreier transversal forms a
spanning tree of the cosets graph of $H$, and thus its topological structure is
of a contractible spanning subcomplex of a simplicial complex. The
$d$-dimensional simplicial complexes that contain contractible spanning
subcomplexes have the homotopy type of a bouquet of $r$ $d$-spheres. When these
complexes are also $n$-regular then $r$ can be computed by generalizing the
rank formula (which applies to Schreier transversals) to higher dimensions.

"math/9412204",,"Amnon Rosenmann","The normalized cyclomatic quotient associated with presentations of
  finitely generated groups","LaTex, 23 pages, no figures",,,"MAGNUS preprint #94-12-28B","math.GR",,"  Given the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group $G$, with respect to a
presentation $G^{\alpha}$ with $n$ generators, the quotient of the rank of the
fundamental group of subgraphs of the Cayley graph by the cardinality of the
set of vertices of the subgraphs gives rise to the definition of the normalized
cyclomatic quotient $\Xi (G^{\alpha})$. The asymptotic behavior of this
quotient is similar to the asymptotic behavior of the quotient of the
cardinality of the boundary of the subgraph by the cardinality of the subgraph.
Using F&#248;lner's criterion for amenability one gets that $\Xi (G^{\alpha})$
vanishes for infinite groups if and only if they are amenable. When $G$ is
finite then $\Xi (G^{\alpha})=1/|G|$, where $|G|$'> is the cardinality of $G$,
and when $G$ is non-amenable then $1-n\leq\Xi (G^{\alpha})\le 0$, with $\Xi
(G^{\alpha})=1-n$ if and only if $G$ is free of rank $n$. Thus we see that on
special cases $\Xi (G^{\alpha})$ takes the values of the Euler characteristic
of $G$. Most of the paper is concerned with formulae for the value of $\Xi
(G^{\alpha})$ with respect to that of subgroups and factor groups, and with
respect to the decomposition of the group into direct product and free product.
Some of the formulae and bounds we get for $\Xi (G^{\alpha})$ are similar to
those given for the spectral radius of symmetric random walks on the graph of
$G^{\alpha}$, but this is not always the case. In the last section of the paper
we define and touch very briefly the balanced cyclomatic quotient, which is
defined on concentric balls in the graph and is related to the growth of $G$.
