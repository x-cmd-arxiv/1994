second fundamental form of a smooth variety with degenerate tangential variety
is subject to certain rank restrictions. The rank restrictions imply a slightly
refined version of Zak's theorem on linear normality and a short proof of the
Zak-Fantecchi theorem on the superadditivity of multisecant defects. We show
there is a vector bundle defined over general points of $TX$ whose fibers carry
the structure of a Clifford algebra. This structure implies additional
restrictions of the size of the secant defect. The Clifford algebra structure,
combined with further local computations, yields a new proof of Zak's theorem
on Severi varieties that is substantially shorter than the original. We also
prove local and global results on the dimension of the Gauss image of
degenerate tangential varieties, refining the results in [GH].

superposition of eigenstates of operators that commute with the constraints and
so correspond to constants of the motion. Contact is made with the usual

run with the Collider Detector at Fermilab from 19.3 pb$^{-1}$ of proton-anti
proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.8$ TeV. From the $W+\geq 3$ jet events, a
""signal sample"" with an improved ratio of $t \bar{t}$ to QCD produced $W$
events is selected by requiring each jet to be emitted centrally in the event
center of mass frame. This sample contains 14 events with unusually hard jet
E$_T$ distributions not well described by expectations for jets from direct QCD
$W$ production and other background processes. Using expected jet E$_T$
distributions, a relative likelihood is defined and used to determine if an
event is more consistent with the decay of $t \bar{t}$ pairs, with M$_{top}$~=~
170 GeV/c$^2$, than with direct QCD $W$ production, while only 1.7 such
top--like events are expected in the absence of $t \bar{t}$. Good agreement in
the jet spectra is obtained if jet production from $t \bar{t}$ pair decays is
included. For those events kinematically more consistent with $t \bar{t}$ we
find evidence for a $b$-quark content in their jets to the extent expected from
top decay, and larger than expected for background processes. For events with
four or more jets, the discrepancy with the predicted jet energy distributions
from direct QCD $W$ production, and the associated excess of $b$-quark content
is more pronounced.
