  v1.2",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  We study cohomology with coefficients in a rank one local system on the
complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes $\A$. The cohomology plays an
important role for the theory of generalized hypergeometric functions. We
combine several known results to construct explicit bases of logarithmic forms
for the only non-vanishing cohomology group, under some nonresonance conditions
on the local system, for any arrangement $\A$. The bases are determined by a
linear ordering of the hyperplanes, and are indexed by certain
``no-broken-circuits"" bases of $\A$. The basic forms depend on the local
system, but any two bases constructed in this way are related by a matrix of
integer constants which depend only on the linear orders and not on the local
system. In certain special cases we show the existence of bases of monomial
logarithmic forms.

algebraically closed field, f:X-> Y a finite map that is birational onto its
image. Suppose that f is curvilinear; that is, at every point of X, the
Jacobian has rank at least n-2. For r at least 1, consider the subscheme N_r of
Y defined by the (r-1)st Fitting ideal of the O_Y-module f_*O_X, and set
M_r:=f^{-1}N_r. In this setting --- in fact, in a more general setting --- we
prove the following statements, which show that M_r and N_r behave like
reasonable schemes of source and target r-fold points of f.
  Each component of M_r and N_r is empty or has dimension at least n-r. If each
component of M_r, or equivalently of N_r, has dimension n-r, then M_r and N_r
are Cohen--Macaulay, and their fundamental cycles satisfy the relation,
f_*[M_r]=r[N_r]. Now, suppose that each component of M_s, or of N_s, has
dimension n-s for s=1,...,r+1. Then the blowup Bl(N_r,N_{r+1}) is equal to the
Hilbert scheme Hilb^r_f, and the blowup Bl(M_r,M_{r+1}) is equal to the
universal subscheme Univ^r_f of Hilb^r_f x_Y X; moreover, Hilb^r_f and Univ^r_f
are Gorenstein. In addition, the structure map h:Hilb^r_f->Y is finite and
birational onto its image; and its conductor is equal to the ideal J_r of
N_{r+1} in N_r, and is locally self-linked. Reciprocally, h_*O_{Hilb^r_f} is
equal to Hom(J_r,O_{N_{r}}). Moreover,
  h_*[h^{-1}N_{r+1}]=(r+1)[N_{r+1}].
  Furthermore, similar assertions hold for the structure map h_1:Univ^r_f->X if
r>1.

spectrum, residing also in a nuclear disc. The gas rotates rapidly and the
emission line widths increase towards the nucleus.
  The images are well fit by an axisymmetric model with the gas and dust in a
disc of 1.5"" radius (340 pc) in the equatorial plane of the stellar body,
viewed at an inclination of 70 degrees. We assume the gas to be on circular
orbits in the equatorial plane, with in addition a local turbulent velocity
dispersion. The circular velocity is calculated from the combined gravitational
potential of the stars and a possible nuclear black hole. The observed gas
rotation curve is well fit, either with or without a black hole. Turbulent
velocities >300 km/s must be present at radii <0.5"" to fit the observed nuclear
line widths. Models with a black hole and no turbulence can also fit the line
widths, but these models cannot fit the observed nuclear line shapes. Models
with both a black hole and gas turbulence can fit the data well, but the black
hole is not required by the data, and if present, its mass must be < 5 x 10^8
solar masses. This upper limit is 5 times smaller than the black hole mass
inferred for M87 from HST data.
  Our modelling and analysis techniques will be useful also for the study of
the kinematics of nuclear gas discs in other galaxies. Such data will yield
important information on the presence of massive black holes.

events for physics signatures and their backgrounds in high energy collisions.
Knowledge of how the produced particles interact with the materials in a
detector makes it possible to simulate the response of any particular detector
design to these events and so determine whether the detector could observe the
signal. The combination of these techniques has played an important role in the
design of new detectors, particularly those for hadron supercolliders where the
high rates and small signal cross sections make the experiments very difficult.
The technique is reviewed here and illustrated using the simulations of the GEM
detector proposed for the Superconducting Super Collider. Although the
simulations and results described here are somewhat detector-specific, we
believe that they can serve as a useful model for this component of detector
design for future hadron supercolliders.

expansion of intersecting Wilson loops in $2D$ $SU(N)$ and $U(N) $Yang Mills

Taylor for partition functions. We prove that these expansions compute Euler
characters of a space of holomorphic maps from string worldsheets with
boundaries. We prove that the Migdal-Makeenko equations hold for the chiral
theory and show that they can be expressed as linear constraints on
perturbations of the chiral $YM2$ partition functions. We briefly discuss
finite $N$ , the non-chiral expansion, and higher dimensional lattice models.

graphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantum
field theories. Whereupon we present a new method, the inserter regularization
method, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this letter, we demonstrate this
method with the $\phi^4$ theory and QED at the one loop order. Some
applications to SUSY-models are also made at the one loop order, which shows
that supersymmetry is preserved manifestly and consistently.

the adjoint representation of the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3) has been
performed. The main emphasis is put on the symmetry properties related to the
homotopically non-trivial gauge transformations and the discrete axial symmetry
of this model. Within a gauge fixed canonical framework, the delicate interplay
of topology on the one hand and Jacobians and boundary conditions arising in
the course of resolving Gauss's law on the other hand is exhibited. As a
result, a consistent description of the residual $Z_N$ gauge symmetry (for
SU(N)) and the ``axial anomaly"" emerges. For illustrative purposes, the vacuum
of the model is determined analytically in the limit of a small circle. There,
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is justified and reduces the vacuum problem
to simple quantum mechanics. The issue of fermion condensates is addressed and
residual discrepancies with other approaches are pointed out.

in superstring compactification, namely those with central charge c = 3d for
some integer d and whose NS fields have integer U(1) charge. The cases d = 1, 2
and 3 are analyzed. It is shown that in the case d >= 3 it is important to use
techniques of algebraic geometry rather than rely on metric-based ideas. The
phase structure of these moduli spaces is discussed in some detail. (Lectures
