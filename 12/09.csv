addressed for both optically and X-ray selected quasar samples. We have applied
a generalized regression algorithm for the case of samples involving censored
data, with errors on both the dependent and the independent variable. Contrary
to some previous results, we find that such relationship is consistent with
being a linear one ($L_x\propto L_o$). We argue that previous reports of
non-linear relationships (i.e. $L_x\propto L_o^e$ with $e < 1$) are due to the
neglect of the influence of the photometric errors, the precise knowledge of
which strongly influences the reliability of the results. Further progresses in
the determination of the $L_o-L_x$ relationship can be achieved with ROSAT
observations of the new generation of large bright quasar surveys.

with an aligned dipole magnetic field. A new aspect of this work is that when
the angular velocity of the star and disk differ substantially we argue that
the $\bf B$ field linking the star and disk rapidly inflates to give regions of
open field lines extending from the polar caps of the star and from the disk.
The open field line region of the disk leads to the possibility of magnetically
driven outflows. An analysis is made of the outflows and their back affect on
the disk structure assuming an ``$\ap$"" turbulent viscosity model for the disk
and a magnetic diffusivity comparable to this viscosity. The outflows are found
to extend over a range of radial distances inward to a distance close to
$r_{to}$, which is the distance of the maximum of the angular rotation rate of
the disk. We find that $r_{to}$ depends on the star's magnetic moment, the
accretion rate, and the disk's magnetic diffusivity. The outflow regime is
accompanied in general by a spin-up of the rotation rate of the star. When
$r_{to}$ exceeds the star's corotation radius $r_{cr} = (GM/\om_*^2)^{1\ov 3}$,
we argue that outflow solutions do not occur, but instead that ``magnetic
braking"" of the star by the disk due to field-line twisting occurs in the
vicinity of $r_{cr}$. The magnetic braking solutions can give spin-up or
spin-down (or no spin change) of the star depending mainly on the star's
magnetic moment and the mass accretion rate. For a system with $r_{to}$
comparable to $r_{cr}$, bimodal behavior is possible where extraneous
perturbations cause the system to flip between spin-up and spin-down.

$t_c/t_f$. The importance of the galactic gravitational field is characterized
by the fractional energy lost radiatively within the flow time in outflows with
velocity equal to the circular velocity of the galaxy; if the fraction is
small, gravity stops the outflow before the gas has a chance to cool
radiatively. In the case the gas does cool radiatively, the cooled gas is most
likely to form clouds via various instabilities. The clouds coast farther away

the hot gas in dwarf galaxies can either flow out as galactic winds, or cools

must integrate in the quantum theory. $\agb$ is a very large space and serves
as a ``universal home'' for measures in theories in which the Wilson loop

projective limit of a projective family of compact Hausdorff manifolds,
labelled by graphs (which can be regarded as ``floating lattices'' in the
physics terminology). Using this characterization, differential geometry is
developed through algebraic methods. In particular, we are able to introduce
the following notions on $\agb$: differential forms, exterior derivatives,
volume forms, vector fields and Lie brackets between them, divergence of a
vector field with respect to a volume form, Laplacians and associated heat
kernels and heat kernel measures. Thus, although $\agb$ is very large, it is
small enough to be mathematically interesting and physically useful. A key
feature of this approach is that it does not require a background metric. The
geometrical framework is therefore well-suited for diffeomorphism invariant
theories such as quantum general relativity.

  Fourth Painleve Equation and their Application to Discrete Equations","Tex file 13 pages",,,"M94/42, Department of Mathematics, University of Exeter","solv-int nlin.SI",,"  In this paper we describe B\""acklund transformations and hierarchies of exact
solutions for the fourth Painlev\'e equation (PIV) $${\d^2 w\over\d
z^2}={1\over2w}\left(\d w\over\d z\right)^2 + {{3\over2}}w^3 + 4zw^2 +
2(z^2-\alpha)w+{\beta\over w},\eqno(1){\hbox to 16pt{\hfill}}$$ with $\alpha$,
$\beta$ constants. Specifically, a nonlinear superposition principle for PIV,
hierarchies of solutions expressible in terms of complementary error or
parabolic cylinder functions as well as rational solutions will be derived.
Included amongst these hierarchies are solutions of (1) for which
$\alpha=\pm\tfr12n$ and $\beta=-\tfr12n^2$, with $n$ an integer. These
particular forms arise in quantum gravity and also satisfy a discrete analogue
of the first Painlev\'e equation. We also obtain a number of exact solutions of
the discrete fourth Painlev\'e equation $$x_{n+1}x_{n-1}+x_n(x_{n+1}+x_{n-1})=
{-2z_nx_n^3+(\eta-3\delta^{-2}-z_n^2)x_n^2+\mu^2\over
(x_n+z_n+\gamma)(x_n+z_n-\gamma)},\eqno(2){\hbox to 16pt{\hfill}}$$}%
{\narrower\noindent\baselineskip=12pt where $z_n=n\delta$ and $\eta$, $\delta$,
$\mu$ and $\gamma$ are constants, which, in an appropriate limit, reduces to
PIV (1). A suitable factorisation of (2) facilitates the identification of a
number of solutions which take the form of ratios of two polynomials in the
variable $z_n$ and the limits of these solutions yield rational solutions of
(1).

  Mathematics, University of Exeter, Exeter, U.K.)","Symmetries and Exact Solutions of a 2+1-dimensional Sine-Gordon System","Tex file 22 pages, figures available from author",,,"M94/44, Department of Mathematics, University of Exeter","solv-int nlin.SI",,"  We investigate the classical and nonclassical reductions of the
$2+1$-dimensional sine-Gordon system of Konopelchenko and Rogers, which is a
strong generalisation of the sine-Gordon equation. A family of solutions
obtained as a nonclassical reduction involves a decoupled sum of solutions of a
generalised, real, pumped Maxwell-Bloch system. This implies the existence of
families of solutions, all occurring as a decoupled sum, expressible in terms
of the second, third and fifth Painlev\'e transcendents, and the sine-Gordon
equation. Indeed, hierarchies of such solutions are found, and explicit
transformations connecting members of each hierarchy are given. By applying a
known B\""acklund transformation for the system to the new solutions found, we
obtain further families of exact solutions, including some which are expressed
as the argument and modulus of sums of products of Bessel functions with
arbitrary coefficients. Finally, we prove the sine-Gordon system has the
Painlev\'e property, which requires the usual test to be modified, and derive a
non-isospectral Lax pair for the generalised, real, pumped Maxwell-Bloch
system.
