fermions in a conducting state are collective charge and spin density
oscillations. The unusual physical properties of such a system (called
``Luttinger liquid'') are characterized by the velocities $u_\rho$ and
$u_\sigma$ of the charge and spin excitations, as well as by a parameter
$K_\rho$ that determines the power law behavior of correlation functions.
Umklapp scattering occuring at half--filling or other commensurate bandfilling
can lead to a transition into an insulating state, characterized in particular
by a gap in the charge excitations (the Mott--Hubbard gap). The properties in
the vicinity of the transition are shown to depend on both the way the
transition is approached (constant bandfilling and varying interaction, or
constant interaction and varying bandfilling) and on the ``order'' of the
commensurability. In particular, even and odd fractional fillings show quite
different behavior. This behavior is illustrated in detail using lattice models

interactions (GPI) -- point-like objects with non-trivial scattering behaviour.
The construction is developed for single centre $S$-wave GPI models with
rational $S$-matrices, and starts from an integral transform suggested by the
scattering data. The theory of unitary dilations is then applied to construct a
unitary mapping between Pontryagin spaces which extend the usual position and
momentum Hilbert spaces. The GPI Hamiltonian is defined as a multiplication
operator on the momentum Pontryagin space and its free parameters are fixed by
a physical locality requirement. We determine the spectral properties and
domain of the Hamiltonian in general, and construct the resolvent and M{\o}ller
wave operators thus verifying that the Hamiltonian exhibits the required
scattering behaviour. The physical Hilbert space is identified. The
construction is illustrated by GPI models representing the effective range
approximation. For negative effective range we recover a known class of GPI
models, whilst the positive effective range models appear to be new. We discuss
the interpretation of these models, along with possible extensions to our
construction.

Specifically we critically study the picture of the ``slow-roll'' phase
transition in the new inflationary models, we show that the instabilities that
are the hallmark of the phase transition, that is the formation of correlated
domains, dramatically change this picture. We analyze in detail the dynamics of
phase separation in strongly supercooled phase transitions in Minkowski space.
We argue that this is typically the situation in weakly coupled scalar
theories. The effective evolution equations for the expectation value and the
fluctuations of an inflaton field in a FRW cosmology are derived both in the
loop expansion and in a self-consistent non-perturbative scheme. Finally we use
these non-equilibrium techniques and concepts to study the influence of quantum
and thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of a proposed mechanism for the
formation of disoriented chiral condensates during a rapid phase transition out
of equilibrium. This last topic may prove to be experimentally relevant at
present accelerator energies. To appear in the Proceedings of the `2nd.

published charged hadron distributions of AGS Experiment 802 for central Si+Au
collisions at 14.6$A$ GeV/$c$, taking into account both the experimental
trigger condition and acceptance. The main features of the data, including
K$^+$ production, can be understood quantitatively to better than 20\% within
the framework of the model, although several discrepancies are found, most
importantly for the proton spectra.

matter is parametrized by introducing density-dependent coupling constants of
isoscalar mesons in the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approach where
isoscalar meson $\sigma$ , $\omega$ and isovector meson $\pi$, $\rho$
contributions are included. The RHF calculations with density dependent
coupling constants obtained in this way not only reproduce the nuclear matter
saturation properties , but also provide the self-energy with an appropriate
density dependence. The relativistic density dependent Hartree-Fock (RDHF)
approach contains the features of the relativistic G matrix and in the meantime
simplifies the calculation. The ground state properties of spherical nuclei
calculated in the RDHF are in good agreement with the experimental data. The
contribution of isovector mesons $\pi$ and $\rho$ , especially the contribution
of the tensor coupling of $\rho$ meson , are discussed in this paper.

and show that there is a potentially infinite set of conserved quantities for
the long time asymptotics. We connect these observations with the exact
integrability of the continuum limit of the DLA (quasi-static Stefan problem).
The conserved quantities of the Stefan problem (harmonic moments) when
discretized are our conserved quantities. These numerical experiments show that
the exact integrability of the Stefan problem may be continued beyond the
formation of cusps in the moving boundary.
