have several major advantages. First, the event rate is strongly dominated by
bulge-bulge lensing events where both the source and lens lie in the bulge.
Second, these bulge-bulge events have very short time scales $t_e\sim 2\,$days
and are therefore easily distinguished from the less frequent and much longer
bulge-disk and disk-disk events. Third, since the optical depth is similar to
that at higher impact parameters, while the events are shorter, the event rate
is high $\Gamma\sim 3\times 10^{-7}\rm day^{-1}$. Fourth, because the Einstein
rings are small, $r_e\sim 5\times 10^{12}\,$cm, and the source stars are large
$r_s\gsim 10^{12}\,$cm, the lens will transit the face of the source for a
significant fraction $(\sim 20\%)$ of events. For these transit events it will
often be possible to measure a second lens parameter, the angular Einstein
radius (or proper motion). In addition to the bulge-bulge events, the optical
depth of the disk is $\sim 7$ times larger toward the inner Galaxy than toward
Baade's Window. A microlensing search toward the inner Galaxy can be carried
out by making frequent $(\sim4\,\rm day^{-1})$ K band images of a large area
$\sim 0.5\,\rm deg^2$ to a depth of $K\sim 16$, and hence requires either a
$1024^2$ infrared array on a dedicated 2m telescope or four such arrays on a 1m

out Monte Carlo simulations of the effects of the binary--single star
encounters on the binary population and distribution in the cluster, and
estimate the collision rate for different stellar populations in globular
clusters with different structural parameters. Assuming a Salpeter IMF, for low
concentration clusters the core encounter rate is dominated by turnoff mass
main--sequence stars and medium mass white dwarfs. For high concentration, high
density clusters the encounter probabilities are increasingly dominated by
neutron stars and heavy white dwarfs. Hence we predict a smaller ratio of blue
stragglers and cataclysmic variables to pulsars in high concentration clusters.
The total number of millisecond pulsars, and the ratio of single to binary
pulsars, is broadly consistent with the observed population, suggesting the
binary--single star encounters contribute significantly to the pulsar formation
rate in globular clusters, for the whole range of globular cluster types. The
number of millisecond pulsars and the ratio of pulsars in different globular
clusters is best explained by a total binary fraction comparable to that of the
galaxy, and a modest number of primordial neutron stars in the globular
clusters.

  Correlation Function in the Linear Regime","14 pages, no figures, uuencoded compressed postscript",,"10.1086/175980",,"astro-ph",,"  The relation between the galaxy correlation function in real and
redshift-space is derived in the linear regime by an appropriate averaging of
the joint probability distribution of density and velocity. The derivation
recovers the familiar linear theory result on large scales but has the
advantage of clearly revealing the dependence of the redshift distortions on
the underlying peculiar velocity field; streaming motions give rise to
distortions of ${\cal O}(\Omega^{0.6}/b)$ while variations in the anisotropic
velocity dispersion yield terms of order ${\cal O}(\Omega^{1.2}/b^2)$. This
probabilistic derivation of the redshift-space correlation function is similar
in spirit to the derivation of the commonly used ``streaming'' model, in which
the distortions are given by a convolution of the real-space correlation
function with a velocity distribution function. The streaming model is often
used to model the redshift-space correlation function on small, highly
non-linear, scales. There have been claims in the literature, however, that the
streaming model is not valid in the linear regime. Our analysis confirms this
claim, but we show that the streaming model can be made consistent with linear
theory {\it provided} that the model for the streaming has the functional form
predicted by linear theory and that velocity distribution is chosen to be a
Gaussian with the correct linear theory dispersion.

in a perfect ring is shown to be essentially the same as for a system of
non-interacting electrons. In contrast, by incorporating into the ring geometry
a tunnel barrier that pins the Wigner crystal, the current is suppressed and
its temperature dependence is drastically changed. The competition between two
temperature effects --- the reduced barrier height for macroscopic tunneling
and loss of quantum coherence --- may result in a sharp peak in the temperature
dependence. The character of the macroscopic quantum tunneling of a Wigner
crystal ring is dictated by the strength of pinning. At strong pinning the
tunneling of a rigid Wigner crystal chain is highly inhomogeneous, and the
persistent current has a well-defined peak at $T\sim 0.5\ \hbar s/L$
independent of the barrier height ($s$ is the sound velocity of the Wigner
crystal, $L$ is the length of the ring). In the weak pinning regime, the Wigner
crystal tunnels through the barrier as a whole and if $V_p>T_0$ the effect of
the barrier is to suppress the current amplitude and to shift the crossover
temperature from $T_0$ to $T^*\simeq \sqrt{V_{p}T_{0}}$. ($V_{p}$ is the
amplitude of the pinning potential, $T_{0} =\hbar v_{F}/L ,\; v_{F}\sim

solution of Einstein's equations is clarified by studying the mathematically
well-defined problem of point-like photon rockets in Minkowski space (i.e.
massive particles emitting null fluid anisotro\-pically and accelerating
because of the recoil). We explicitly compute the (uniquely defined) {\it
linearized} retarded gravitational waves emitted by such objects, which are the
coherent superposition of the gravitational waves generated by the motion of
the massive point-like rocket and of those generated by the energy-momentum
distribution of the photon fluid. In the special case (corresponding to
Kinnersley's solution) where the anisotropy of the photon emission is purely
dipolar we find that the gravitational wave amplitude generated by the
energy-momentum of the photons exactly cancels the usual $1/r$ gravitational
wave amplitude generated by the accelerated motion of the rocket. More general
photon anisotropies would, however, generate genuine gravitational radiation at
infinity. Our explicit calculations show the compatibility between the
non-radiative character of Kinnersley's solution and the currently used
gravitational wave generation formalisms based on post-Minkowskian perturbation
theory.

quantum planes and the requirement that the Poincare series coincides with the
classical one. It is shown that this implies the existence of a Yang-Baxter
operator. Exploiting stronger equations arising at degree four of the algebra,
we classify all quantum matrix groups GL(3). We find 26 classes of solutions,
two of which do not admit a normal ordering. The corresponding R-matrices are
given.

squeezed vacuum and show that the distribution of photons among the two modes
depends on four parameters: two squeezing parameters, the relative phase
between the two oscillators and their spatial orientation. The distribution of
the total number of photons depends only on the two squeezing parameters. We
derive analytical expressions and present pictures for both distributions.
