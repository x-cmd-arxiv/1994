the X-ray emission originates from galaxies in the group. On the contrary,
three groups show an extended emission clearly caused by hot intracluster gas.
A Raymond-Smith hot plasma model provides an excellent fit to the X-ray
spectra. The estimated temperatures are distributed in a quite narrow range
(from 0.73 to 0.92 keV) and are consistent, within the errors, with 0.9 keV.
The luminosity ranging from 0.75 to $5.1\cdot10^{42}$erg s$^{-1}$. The most

likely in a third that characterizes the hot gas cloud responsible for the

not sufficient to discriminate with certainty between diffuse and/or point-like
X-ray emission. However the results of the spectral analysis point to the
presence of a hot gas again with low metal abundance.

predictions for elementary particle and hadrons masses (hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov
9410058-62). The gauge group of TGD is just the gauge group of the standard
model so that it makes sense to study the p-adic counterpart of the standard
model as a candidate for low energy effective theory. Momentum eigen states can
be constructed purely number theoretically and the infrared cutoff implied by
the finite size of the convergence cube of p-adic square root function leads to
momentum discretization. Discretization solves ultraviolet problems: the number
of momentum states associated with a fixed value of the propagator expression
in the loop is integer and has p-adic norm not larger than one so that the
contribution of momentum squared with p-adic norm $p^{k}$ converges as
$p^{-2k-2}$ for boson loop. The existence of the action exponential forces
number theoretically the decomposition into free and interacting parts. The
free part is of order $O(p^0)$ and must vanish (and does so by equations of
motion) and interaction part is at most of order $O(\sqrt{p})$ p-adically.
p-Adic coupling constants are of form $g\sqrt{p}$: their real counterparts are
obtained by canonical identification between p-adic and real numbers. The
discretized version of Feynmann rules of real theory should give S-matrix
elements but Feynmann rules guarantee unitarity in formal sense only. The
unexpected result is the upper bound $L_p=L_0/\sqrt{p}$ ($L_0\sim
10^4\sqrt{G}$) for the size of p-adic convergence cube from the cancellation of
infrared divergences so that p-adic field theory doesn't make sense above
