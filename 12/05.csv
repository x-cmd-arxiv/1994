  $x in R^{n}$, $n geq 1$, $m geq 1$, $d > 1$,
  with bounded uniformly continuous nonnegative initial data. For such initial
data, solutions can be simple traveling fronts or complicated domain walls. Due
to the well-known thermal-diffusive instabilities when $d$, the Lewis number,
is sufficiently away from one, front solutions are potentially chaotic. It is
known in the literature that solutions are uniformly bounded in time in case $d
leq 1$ by a simple comparison argument. In case $d >1$, no comparison principle
seems to apply. Nevertheless, we prove the existence of global classical
solutions and show that the $L^{infty}$ norm of $u_2$ can not grow faster than
$O(log log t)$ for any space dimension. Our main tools are local $L^{p}$
a-priori estimates and time dependent spatially decaying test functions. Our
results also hold for the Arrhenius type reactions.

vortex in a type-II superconductor at T=0 is given. All work assumes a charged
BCS superconductor. We first examine the Berry phase induced in the BCS ground
state by movement of the vortex and show how this phase enters into the
hydrodynamic action S_hyd of the condensate. Appropriate variation of S_hyd
gives F_nd and variation of the Berry phase term is seen to contribute the
Magnus force of classical hydrodynamics to F_nd. This analysis confirms in
detail the arguments of Ao and Thouless within the context of the BCS model.
Our Berry phase, in the limit e -> 0, reproduces the Berry phase they obtain
for a neutral superfluid. A second independent determination of F_nd is given
through a microscopic derivation of the continuity equation for the condensate
linear momentum. This yields the acceleration equation for the superflow. The
vortex is seen to act as a momentum sink and the rate of momentum loss yields
F_nd. Both calculations yield the same F_nd and show that the Magnus force
contribution to F_nd is a consequence of the vortex motion and topology.

decays $B \to \psi K(K^{\ast})$ (in particular recent po\-la\-ri\-za\-tion
data) severely constrain the form (normalization and $q^2$ dependence) of the
heavy-to-light meson form factors, if we assume the factorization hypothesis
for the latter. From a simultaneous fit to \bpsi and \dk data we find that
strict heavy quark limit scaling laws applied to the form factors do not hold
when going from $D$ to $B$ and must have large corrections that make softer the
dependence on the masses. This is in contrast with the matrix elements
themselves which are found to need smaller $1/m_Q$ corrections to the
asymptotic heavy quark scaling laws. We also find that $A_1(q^2)$ should
increase slower with \qq than $A_2, V, f_+$. We propose a simple
parametrization of these corrections based on a quark model or on an extension
of the \hhs laws to the \hl case, complemented with an approximately constant
$A_1(q^2)$. This model may be viewed as assuming a precocious validity of
strict heavy quark scaling laws for the current matrix elements. Although this
model reproduces qualitatively the wanted features for mass and $q^2$
dependence, and thus reduces the discrepancy with data, it is insufficient to
reach a full agreement with the experiment. In our opinion the puzzle is still

harmonic confinement potential for the constituent quarks and an SU(3)
flavor-symmetric interaction mediated by the pseudoscalar octet that is
associated with the hidden approximate chiral symmetry of QCD. The spectrum is
formed of multiplets of $SU(6)_{FS}\times U(6)_{conf}$, which are mixed by the
octet interaction. With 4 matrix elements of the octet mediated interaction
determined by the lowest mass splittings in the nucleon spectrum the resulting
mass formula predicts the whole spectrum with an accuracy of $\sim$ 5\%.

determine the extrinsic curvature invariants. These are demonstrated to be
finite, in contradiction with naive expectation. Thus the Nambu action is a
valid approximation for the motion of a cosmic string vortex even at cusps.
This suggests that cusp annihilation is not a feasible mechanism for particle
radiation from cosmic strings.

binomial (q-binomial) identities derived from a truncation of the state
counting equations of the XXZ spin ${1\over 2}$ chain of anisotropy
$-\Delta=-\cos(\pi{p\over p'})$. We use the Takahashi-Suzuki method to express
the allowed values of $r$ (and $s$) in terms of the continued fraction
decomposition of $\{{p'\over p}\}$ (and ${p\over p'}$) where $\{x\}$ stands for
the fractional part of $x.$ These values are, in fact, the dimensions of the
hermitian irreducible representations of $SU_{q_{-}}(2)$ (and $SU_{q_{+}}(2)$)
with $q_{-}=\exp (i \pi \{{p'\over p}\})$ (and $q_{+}=\exp ( i \pi {p\over
p'})).$ We also establish the duality relation $M(p,p')\leftrightarrow
M(p'-p,p')$ and discuss the action of the Andrews-Bailey transformation in the
space of minimal models. Many new identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type are
presented.

Landau--Ginzburg models by abelian twists with arbitrary discrete torsions.
Compared to the case without torsion the number of new spectra is surprisingly
small. In contrast to a popular expectation mirror symmetry does not seem to be
related to discrete torsion (at least not in the present compactification
framework): The Berglund-H""ubsch construction naturally extends to orbifolds
with torsion; for more general potentials, on the other hand, the new spectra
neither have nor provide mirror partners in our class of models.

three-nucleon binding energy in terms of the $\pi N$ amplitude using
perturbation theory, we are able to determine the importance of the energy
dependence and the contribution of the different partial waves of the $\pi N$
amplitude to the three-nucleon force. A separable representation of the
non-pole $\pi N$ amplitude allows us to write the three-nucleon force in terms
of the amplitude for $NN\rightarrow NN^*$, propagation of the $NNN^*$ system,
and the amplitude for $NN^*\rightarrow NN$, with $N^*$ being the $\pi N$
quasi-particle amplitude in a given state. The division of the $\pi N$
amplitude into a pole and non-pole gives a procedure for the determination of
the $\pi NN$ form factor within the model. The total contribution of the
three-body force to the binding energy of the triton for the separable
approximation to the Paris nucleon-nucleon potential (PEST) is found to be very
small mainly as a result of the energy dependence of the $\pi N$ amplitude, the
cancellation between the $S$- and $P$-wave $\pi N$ amplitudes, and the soft
$\pi NN$ form factor.
