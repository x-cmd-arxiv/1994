the radio nebula surrounding the soft gamma ray repeater (SGR) 1806-20. The
quiescent X-ray source AX1805.7-2025 is coincident with the radio core
suggesting that G10.0-0.3 is a plerionic supernova remnant. The monitoring
experiment was performed in 10 epochs spread over five months, starting just
before the latest reactivation of SGR 1806-20 in gamma-rays. There is no
apparent increase in the radio flux density from the central region of
G10.0-0.3 on timescales of days to months following the gamma-ray bursts. At a
resolution of 1 arcsec the peak region of G10.0-0.3 is seen to consist of a
compact source with diffuse, one-sided emission, reminiscent of core-jet
geometry seen in AGNs and some accreting Galactic binaries. By analogy with
these latter sources, we argue that the SGR 1806-20 is coincident with the core
component. If so, this is the first arcsecond localization of a high energy
transient. The lack of radio variability and the low brightness temperature of
the central component distinguish SGR 1806-20 from other accreting binaries.
The structure of the high resolution radio image also does not particularly
resemble that seen in the vicinity of young pulsars. Thus there is no
compelling observational evidence for either of the two models discussed for
SGRs, the pulsar model or the accreting binary model.

the local Universe, j_0, has been estimated for two galaxy catalogues (UGC and

of phase transitions in pure gauge and scalar lattice QED. Main results are as
follows: Pure gauge compact QED with PBC shows a monopole percolation phenomena
coupled to the monopole condensation. Pure gauge compact QED with Fixed
Boundary Conditions (spherical topology) shows a behaviour compatible with a
second order phase transition The $\gamma\to\infty$ limit of Non Compact Scalar
QED with PBC is related to the Villain form of compact QED and also to the Loop
Model for QED, showing a first order phase transition. Numerical a analysis of
a third rank abelian Z(2) theory shows an intriguing behaviour over the phase
transition that may be originated by point-like topological excitations.

well-motivated assumptions: (a). Adler-Weisberger-type sum rules and the
superconvergence relations for scattering amplitudes hold in this strongly
interacting sector; (b). the sum rules at $t=0$ are saturated by a minimal set
of low-lying states with appropriate quantum numbers. It therefore suggests
that a complete description should include all these resonances. These states
may lead to distinctive experimental signatures at future colliders.

coupling for some 1-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. First we
use the Schwarzian differential equation, which we derived previously, to
characterize the mirror map in each case. For algebraic K3 surfaces, we solve
the equation in terms of the $J$-function. By deriving explicit modular
relations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zero
function field ${\bf Q}(J)$. This leads to a uniform proof that those mirror
maps have integral Fourier coefficients. Regarding the maps as Riemann
mappings, we prove that they are genus zero functions. By virtue of the
Conway-Norton conjecture (proved by Borcherds using Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman's
Moonshine module), we find that these maps are actually the reciprocals of the
Thompson series for certain conjugacy classes in the Griess-Fischer group. This
also gives, as an immediate consequence, a second proof that those mirror maps
are integral. We thus conjecture a surprising connection between K3 mirror maps
and the Thompson series. For threefolds, we construct a formal nonlinear ODE
for the quantum coupling reduced $mod\ p$. Under the mirror hypothesis and an
integrality assumption, we derive $mod~p$ congruences for the Fourier
coefficients. For the quintics, we deduce (at least for $5\not{|}d$) that the
degree $d$ instanton numbers $n_d$ are divisible by $5^3$ -- a fact first
conjectured by Clemens.

system of functional equations. Several new functional equations are described

obtained. It is found that for the nonpolynomial potentials the coefficients
may increase as $n!$. But increasing may be more slow if the contributions with
opposite signs cancel each other. Particularly, it is not excluded that for
number of the potentials the expansion is convergent. For the polynomial
potentials $\Dt$-expansion is certainly asymptotic one. The coefficients
increase in this case as $\Gamma(n \frac{L-2}{L+2})$, where $L$ is the order of
the polynom. It means that the point $\Dt=0$ is singular point of the kernel.

field are best studied with the projection formalism of Geroch. When the
Killing vector is lightlike, the projection onto the orbit space still exists
and one expects a covariant theory with degenerate contravariant metric to
appear, its geometry is presented here. Despite the complications of
indecomposable representations of the local Euclidean subgroup, one obtains an
absolute time and a canonical, Galilean and so-called Newtonian, torsionless
connection. The quasi-Maxwell field (Kaluza Klein one-form) that appears in the
dimensional reduction is a non-separable part of this affine connection, in
contrast to the reduction with a non-null Killing vector. One may define the
Kaluza Klein scalar (dilaton) together with the absolute time coordinate after
having imposed one of the equations of motion in order to prevent the emergence
of torsion. We present a detailed analysis of the dimensional reduction using
moving frames, we derive the complete equations of motion and propose an action
whose variation gives rise to all but one of them. Hidden symmetries are shown
to act on the space of solutions.
