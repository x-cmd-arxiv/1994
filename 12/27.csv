permitting individuals to decrease the risks associated with cooperation. In
large populations, defectors may escape punishment by roving from partner to
partner, but defectors in smaller populations risk social isolation. We
investigate these possibilities for an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma in which
agents use expected payoffs to choose and refuse partners. In comparison to
random or round-robin partner matching, we find that the average payoffs
attained with preferential partner selection tend to be more narrowly confined
to a few isolated payoff regions. Most ecologies evolve to essentially full
cooperative behavior, but when agents are intolerant of defections, or when the
costs of refusal and social isolation are small, we also see the emergence of
wallflower ecologies in which all agents are socially isolated. In between
these two extremes, we see the emergence of ecologies whose agents tend to
engage in a small number of defections followed by cooperation thereafter. The
latter ecologies exhibit a plethora of interesting social interaction patterns.

framework of large dimensions the Green function of a hole can be obtained
exactly. The exact density of states of a hole is thus calculated in large
dimensions and on a Bethe lattice with large coordination number. We suggest a
physically motivated generalization to finite dimensions (e.g., 2 and 3). In
$d=2$ we present also the momentum dependent spectral function. With varying
degree, depending on the underlying lattice involved, the discrete spectrum for
holes is replaced by a continuum background and a few resonances at the low
energy end. The latter are the remanents of the bound states of the $t-J$
model. Their behavior is still largely governed by the parameters $t$ and $J$.
The continuum excitations are more sensitive to the energy scales $t$ and

this RG flow is shown to act as a *filter* on the renormalized Lagrangian

covariance can be recovered only by choosing some particular operator orderings

normal ordering but still satisfies all the necessary conditions. Furthermore,
we show that the equations of motion can be expressed in a similar form
