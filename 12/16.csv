origin of these highest energy cosmic rays remains unknown. Established
astrophysical acceleration mechanisms encounter severe difficulties in
accelerating particles to these energies. Alternative scenarios where these
particles are created by the decay of cosmic topological defects have been
suggested in literature. In this paper we study the possibility of producing
the highest energy cosmic rays through a process that involves formation of
metastable magnetic monopole-antimonopole bound states and their subsequent
collapse. The annihilation of the heavy monopole-antimonopole pairs
constituting the monopolonia can produce energetic nucleons, gamma rays and
neutrinos whose expected flux we estimate and discuss in relation to
experimental data so far available. The monopoles we consider are the ones that
could be produced in the early universe during a phase transition at the grand
unification energy scale. We find that observable cosmic ray fluxes can be
produced with monopole abundances compatible with present bounds.

the complex power of a pseudo differential operator, to give an unambiguous
definition of the determinant of the Dirac operator. We bring this definition
to a workable form by making use of an asymmetric Wigner representation. The
expression so obtained is amenable to several treatments of which we consider
in detail two, the inverse mass expansion and the gradient expansion, with
concrete examples. We obtain explicit closed expressions for the corresponding
Seeley-DeWitt coefficients to all orders. The determinant is shown to be vector
gauge invariant and to posses the correct axial and scale anomalies. The main
virtue of our approach is that it is conceptually simple and systematic and can
be extended naturally to more general problems (bosonic operators,
gravitational fields, etc). In particular, it avoids defining the real and
imaginary parts of the effective action separately. In addition, it does not
reduce the problem to a bosonic one to apply heat kernel nor performs further
analytical rotations of the fields to make the Dirac operator Hermitian. We
illustrate the flexibility of the method by studying some interesting cases.
