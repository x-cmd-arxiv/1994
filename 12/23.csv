haloes. The statistical properties of dark haloes are determined from the
initial density field (assumed to be Gaussian) through an extension of the
Press-Schechter formalism. Gravitational clustering is treated by a spherical
model which describes the concentration of dark haloes in collapsing regions.
We test this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations. The
autocorrelation function of dark haloes in such simulations depends
significantly on how haloes are identified. Our predictions agree well with
results based on algorithms which break clusters into subgroups more
efficiently than the standard friends-of-friends algorithm. The agreement is
better than that found by assuming haloes to lie at the present positions of
peaks of the linear density field. We use these techniques to study how the
distribution of haloes is biased with respect to that of the mass. The initial
(Lagrangian) positions of haloes identified at a given redshift and having
circular velocities $v_c=v_c^*(z)$ (i.e. mass equal to the characteristic
nonlinear mass $M^*$ at that redshift) are very weakly correlated with the
linear density field or among themselves. As a result of dynamical evolution,
however, the present-day correlations of these haloes are similar to those of
the mass. Haloes with lower $v_c$ are biased toward regions with negative
overdensity, while those with higher $v_c$ are biased toward regions with
positive overdensity. Among the haloes identified at any given epoch, those
with higher circular velocities are more strongly correlated today. Among the
haloes of given circular velocity, those at higher redshifts are also more
strongly clustered today. In the ``standard CDM'' model, haloes with

evolutions. In this paper we report on the details of the implementation of
this scheme. The scheme is based on using (1)~a horizon locking coordinate
which locks the coordinate system to the geometry, and (2)~a finite
differencing scheme which respects the causal structure of the spacetime. We
show that the horizon locking coordinate can be affected by a number of shift
conditions, such as a ``distance freezing'' shift, an ``area freezing'' shift,
an ``expansion freezing'' shift, or the minimal distortion shift. The causal
differencing scheme is illustrated with the evolution of scalar fields, and its
use in evolving the Einstein equations is studied. We compare the results of
numerical evolutions with and without the use of this horizon boundary
condition scheme for spherical black hole spacetimes. With the boundary
condition a black hole can be evolved accurately well beyond $t=1000 M$, where
$M$ is the black hole mass.

$SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. The first,
conventional, formulation employs the affine symmetry of the model; in this
approach correlation functions are derived from the so-called
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The second formulation is based on an
entirely different algebraic structure, the so-called Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. In
this approach, the Hilbert space of the theory is obtained by repeated
application of modes of the so-called spinon field, which has $SU(2)$ spin
$j=\thalf$ and obeys fractional (semionic) statistics. We show how this new
formulation, which can be generalized to many other rational conformal field
theories, can be used to compute correlation functions and to obtain new
expressions for the Virasoro and affine characters in the theory. [Lectures

arising directly from a vanishing self-dual curvature condition on an
$SU(2)$-bundle in which the fermions are realized as spanning the tangent space

In particular we work out the dependence on the continuous Wilson line moduli
fields. In addition we concentrate on the physically interesting effect that at
certain critical points in the orbifold moduli spaces additional massless
states appear in the string spectrum leading to logarithmic singularities in
the threshold functions. We discuss this effect for the gauge coupling
threshold corrections; here the appearance of additional massless states is
directly related to the Higgs effect in string theory. In addition the
singularities in the threshold functions are relevant for the loop corrections
to the gravitational coupling constants.
