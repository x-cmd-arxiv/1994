fact that it is generally assumed that the luminosity and lifetimes of main

convection and atmospheres, two areas of stellar evolution which are poorly
understood. Several possible sources of error in this stellar clock are
discussed, and isochrones are constructed using a variety of different physical
assumptions. The mean age of the oldest globular clusters are determined from
these isochrones and it is found that the uncertainties in the input physics
can lead to changes in the derived age of $\pm 15\%$. Surprisingly the largest
source of error is the mixing length theory of convection. It is well known
that uncertainties in the distance scale and chemical composition of globular
cluster stars lead to changes of order $\sim 22\%$ in the determination of
absolute ages. Combining the various sources of error, the absolute age of the
oldest globular clusters are found to lie in the range 11 --- 21 Gyr. This is

galaxy that contains a large scale, arc-like feature of radius 3 kpc in its
outer disk at a distance of $\sim$ 11 kpc from the center. What is unusual
about this arc-like feature is its stellar nature and the presence of a
luminous star cluster at its center. The arc is fragmented into HII region
complexes and OB star clusters and shows two kinks in optical continuum light.
It spans an angle of 220$^{\circ}$ on our U image and a full, though
fragmented, circle on an unsharp masked R image. It is centered on a young star
cluster that is the most luminous clump in blue optical continuum light besides
the nucleus of the galaxy. This central star cluster has UBR colors and a
surface brightness similar to those of other HII regions, but is a relatively
weak H$\alpha$ emitter. It consists of at least three unresolved condensations
in optical continuum light. Its location at the center of the arc and its
prominence within the galaxy suggests that it has been the site of several
generations of supernova explosions that swept up the surrounding gas into a
supershell. When it attained a radius of $0.5-1$ kpc, this shell became
gravitationally unstable and formed the stars which now delineate the arc. The
constraints imposed by the survival of the expanding arc against random stellar
motions and the age of the stars in the arc yield a required energy input by a
minimum of 400 and a maximum of 6500 supernovae. In this scenario the asymmetry
in surface brightness of the arc reflects the radial gradient of the gas
density in the disk of NGC 1620, while the kinks reflect inhomogeneities in the
original gas distribution with respect to the central star cluster. The

This problem can be alleviated by clustering, because it reduces the number of
free parameters that need to be trained. However, clustered models have the
following drawback: if there is ``enough'' data to train an unclustered model,
then the clustered variant may perform worse. On currently used language
modeling corpora, e.g. the Wall Street Journal corpus, how do the performances
of a clustered and an unclustered model compare? While trying to address this
question, we develop the following two ideas. First, to get a clustering
algorithm with potentially high performance, an existing algorithm is extended
to deal with higher order N-grams. Second, to make it possible to cluster large
amounts of training data more efficiently, a heuristic to speed up the
algorithm is presented. The resulting clustering algorithm can be used to
cluster trigrams on the Wall Street Journal corpus and the language models it
produces can compete with existing back-off models. Especially when there is
only little training data available, the clustered models clearly outperform
the back-off models.

interactions. The quantum dynamics are associated with a finite moment of
inertia for the rotors, and with the transverse field for the Ising spins. For
a suitable distribution of exchange constants, these models display spin glass
and quantum paramagnet phases and a zero temperature quantum transition between
them. An earlier exact solution for the critical properties of a model with
infinite-range interactions can be reproduced by minimization of a Landau
effective-action functional for the model in finite $d$ with short-range
interactions. The functional is expressed in terms of a composite spin field
which is bilocal in time. The mean-field phase diagram near the zero
temperature critical point is mapped out as a function of temperature, strength
of the quantum coupling, and applied fields. The spin glass ground state is
found to be replica symmetric, with replica symmetry breaking appearing only at
finite temperatures. Next we examine the consequences of fluctuations about
mean-field for the critical properties. Above $d=8$, and with certain
restrictions on the values of the Landau couplings, we find that the transition
is controlled by a Gaussian fixed point with mean-field critical exponents. For
couplings not attracted by the Gaussian fixed point above $d=8$, and for all
physical couplings below $d=8$, we find runaway renormalization group flows to
strong coupling. General scaling relations that should be valid even at the

considered and applied to systems which contain an `almost ideal clock.'
Previously, this formalism was successfully applied to the Bianchi models and,
while it contains no fundamental notion of `time' or `evolution,' the approach
does contain a notion of correlations. Using correlations with the almost ideal
clock to introduce a notion of time, the work below derives the complete
formalism of external time quantum mechanics. The limit of an ideal clock is
found to be closely associated with the Klein-Gordon inner product and the
Newton-Wigner formalism and, in addition, this limit is shown to fail for a
clock that measures metric-defined proper time near a singularity in Bianchi
models.

Moonshine, the genus zero property for Thompson series which we have shown is
equivalent to the property that the only meromorphic $Z_n$ orbifoldings of
$V^\natural$ are $V^\Lambda$ and $V^\natural$ itself (assuming that
$V^\natural$ is uniquely determined by its characteristic function $J(\tau)$.
We show that these constraints on the possible $Z_n$ orbifoldings of
$V^\natural$ are also sufficient to demonstrate the genus zero property for
Generalised Moonshine functions in the simplest non-trivial prime cases by
considering $Z_p\times Z_p$ orbifoldings of $V^\natural$. Thus Monstrous
Moonshine implies Generalised Moonshine in these cases.

to the composite structure of particles. It is shown, that there are no such
thresholds in physical amplitudes which are associated with confined
constituents, like quarks and gluons in QCD. Unphysical amplitudes are
considered briefly, using propagator functions as an example. For general,

string theory in any curved spacetime is reviewed. When the curvature is smooth
the string solutions are deformed folded string solutions as compared to flat
spacetime folded strings that were known for 19 years. However, surprizing new
stringy behavior becomes evident at singularities such as black holes. The
global properties of these solutions require that the ``bare singularity
region""of the black hole be included along with the usual black hole spacetime.
The mathematical structure needed to describe the solutions include a recursion
relation that is analogous to the transfer matrix of lattice theories. This
encodes lattice properties on the worldsheet on the one hand and the geometry
of spacetime on the other hand. A case is made for the presence of folded
strings in the quantum theory of non-critical strings for $d\geq 2$.
