basis functions provides an objective means of estimating the number of
significant spectral components that comprise a particular galaxy type. We
apply the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve transform to derive a spectral eigensystem from a
sample of ten galaxy spectral energy distributions. These spectra cover a
wavelength range of 1200 \AA\ to 1 $\mu$m and galaxy morphologies from
elliptical to starburst. We find that the distribution of spectral types can be
fully described by the first two eigenvectors (or eigenspectra). The derived
eigenbasis is affected by the normalization of the original spectral energy
distributions. We investigate different normalization and weighting schemes,
including weighting to the same bolometric magnitude and weighting by the
observed distribution of morphological types. Projecting the spectral energy
distributions on to their eigenspectra we find that the coefficients define a
simple spectral classification scheme. The galaxy spectral types can then be
described in terms of a one parameter family (the angle in the plane of the
first two eigenvectors). We find a strong correlation in the mean between our
spectral classifications and those determined from published morphological
classifications.

profiles and the morphologies of galaxy clusters in three models of structure
formation. We show that these properties are closely related to the occurrence
of a significant merging event to a cluster in the recent past. The three
models are: (1) the standard CDM model (SCDM) with $\Omega_0 = 1$,
$\Lambda_0=0$ and $h=0.5$; (2) a low-density flat model (LCDM) with
$\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0.7$ and $h=0.75$; (3) a CDM dominated open model
(OCDM) with $\Omega_0=0.1$, $\Lambda_0=0$. We find that the clusters in the
OCDM model have the steepest density profiles, their density contours are the
roundest and show the smallest center shifts, among the three models. The
clusters in the SCDM model have contours that are most elongated and show the
largest center shifts, indicating the existence of frequent mergers in the
recent past. The clusters in the LCDM model have density profiles and center
shifts (in their density contours) similar to those in the SCDM model, although
the density contours tend to be rounder. Our results show that, although the
density profiles and morphologies of clusters depend on models of structure
formation, the LCDM model, which is currently considered as a successful
alternative to the SCDM model, can do as well in producing a substantial
fraction of clusters with substructures. This is in contrast to the conception
that this model may have serious problem in this aspect.

the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and
understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein
conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy
landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific
folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the
distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those
peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative
insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein
folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple
explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the
origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius
plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations.
The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to
uni-exponential {\em vs.} multi-exponential behavior in protein folding
experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The
success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also
described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is
illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a
qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work
unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein
folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different

asymmetric case of off-critical quenches for systems with a conserved scalar
order parameter. In this instance the new parameter $M$, the average global
value of the order parameter, enters the theory. For $M=0$ one has critical
quenches, while for sufficiently large $M$ one approaches the coexistence
curve. For all $M$ the theory supports a scaling solution for the order
parameter correlation function with the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner growth law $L
\sim t^{1/3}$. The theoretically determined scaling function depends only on
the spatial dimensionality $d$ and the parameter $M$, and is determined
explicitly here in two and three dimensions. Near the coexistence curve
oscillations in the scaling function are suppressed. The structure factor
displays Porod's law $Q^{-(d+1)}$ behaviour at large scaled wavenumbers $Q$,
and $Q^{4}$ behaviour at small scaled wavenumbers, for all $M$. The peak in the
structure factor widens as $M$ increases and develops a significant tail for
quenches near the coexistence curve. This is in qualitative agreement with
simulations.

transformation is used to locate a critical plane of the disordered model. This
critical plane corresponds to the line of critical points of the pure model,
along which critical exponents vary continuously. Along this line the scaling
exponent corresponding to randomness $\phi=(\alpha/\nu)$ varies continuously
and is positive so that randomness is relevant and different critical behaviour
is expected for the disordered model. We use a cluster algorithm for the Monte
Carlo simulations based on the Wolff embedding idea, and perform a finite size
scaling study of several critical models, extrapolating between the critical
bond-disordered Ising and bond-disordered four state Potts models. The critical
behaviour of the disordered model is compared with the critical behaviour of an
anisotropic Ashkin-Teller model which is used as a refference pure model. We
find no essential change in the order parameters' critical exponents with
respect to those of the pure model. The divergence of the specific heat $C$ is
changed dramatically. Our results favor a logarithmic type divergence at
$T_{c}$, $C\sim \log L$ for the random bond Ashkin-Teller and four state Potts

approximation using an infrared (IR) vanishing gluon propagator that introduces
an IR mass scale $b$. There exists a $b$ dependent critical coupling indicating
the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry. If one chooses realistic QCD
coupling constants the strength and the scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking decouple from the IR scale for small $b$ while for large $b$ no
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking occurs. At timelike momenta the quark
propagator possesses a pole, at least for a large range of the parameter $b$.
Therefore it is suggestive that quarks are not confined in this model for all
values of $b$. Furthermore, we argue that the quark propagator is analytic
within the whole complex momentum plane except on the timelike axis. Hence the
na\""{\i}ve Wick rotation is allowed.

The complete spacetime required to describe the classical string motions turns
out to be larger than the global space required by complete particle geodesics.
The solutions are fully classified by their behavior in the asymptotically flat
region of spacetime. When the curvature is smooth, the string solutions are
deformed folded string solutions as compared to flat spacetime folded strings
that were known for 19 years. However, surprizing new stringy behavior becomes
evident at curvature singularities such as black holes. The global properties
of the classical string theory require that the ``bare singularity region'' of
the black hole be included along with the usual black hole spacetime. The
mathematical structure needed to describe the solutions include a recursion
relation that is analogous to the transfer matrix of lattice theories. This
encodes lattice-like properties on the worldsheet on the one hand and the
geometry of spacetime on the other hand. A case is made for the presence of
folded strings in the quantum theory of non-critical strings for $d\geq 2$.

The inductive causal method by Epstein and Glaser leads directly to a finite

theory. The causal method naturally separates the physical infrared problem of
massless theories from ultraviolet-sensitive features like normalizability by
regarding the distributional character of the S-matrix. We prove the
normalizability of the Yang-Mills theory with fermionic matter fields and study
the discrete symmetry transformations in the causal formalism. We introduce a
definition of nonabelian gauge invariance which only involves the free
asymptotic field operators and give mathematically rigorous and conceptually
simple proofs of nonabelian gauge invariance and of the physical unitarity of
the S-matrix in all orders of perturbation theory.
