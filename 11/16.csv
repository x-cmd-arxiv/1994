that they have a hot tenuous corona above. In the opposite {\it

spherical accretion. The gas is almost at virial temperature, rotates at much
below the Keplerian rate, and the flow is much more akin to Bondi accretion
than to disk accretion. We compare our exact self-similar solutions with
approximate solutions previously obtained using a height-integrated system of
equations. We conclude that the height- integration approximation is excellent
for a wide range of conditions. We find that the Bernoulli parameter is
positive in all our solutions, especially close to the rotation axis. This
effect is produced by viscous transport of energy from small to large radii and
from the equator to the poles. In addition, all the solutions are convectively
unstable and the convection is especially important near the rotation axis. For
both reasons we suggest that a bipolar outflow will develop along the axis of
the flows, fed by material from the the surface layers of the equatorial

may be a massive accreting black holes. The black hole hypothesis is, however,
problematic because no model of Sgr A* has been able to explain the observed
spectrum in any self-consistent way, and there is no consensus on either the
mass of the black hole or the mass accretion rate. Sgr A* has been observed in
the radio, sub-mm, infrared, and X-ray bands, and the various various
detections and flux upper limits cover more than ten decades of frequency, from
$\nu\sles\ 10^9$ Hz (meter wavelength radio bands) up to $\nu\ \sgreat\
10^{19}$ Hz (150 keV X-rays). We present a robust model of Sgr A* in which a
million solar mass black hole accretes at the rate of a few $\times10^{-6}$
solar masses per year. This model fits the entire spectrum self-consistently.
The unique feature of the model is that the flow is advection-dominated, i.e.
most of the energy viscously dissipated in the differentially rotating flow is
carried along with the gas and lost through the horizon. The apparent success
of this model in explaining the data may be considered ``proof'' that horizons
are real and that a massive black hole does exist at the Galactic center.

as well as changes of the wind characteristics. We derive the conditions under

J0045-7319) can undergo a transition to the accreting regime. A strong increase
of the mass loss ouflow from the companion is required, just to cause the onset
of accretion onto the magnetospheric boundary. We also show that the X--ray
transient A0538-66 is likely to undergo transitions from the accreting neutron
star regime, to the regime of accretion onto the magnetosphere. These two
regimes might correspond to the high (> 10^{38} erg/s) and the low-luminosity

cooling, is correlated with a significant increase in icosahedral ordering. In
fact, the structure of the final state, as measured by an analysis of the
bonding, is essentially the same in the glassy, frozen state whether produced
by squeezing or by cooling under pressure. We have computed an effective
hard-sphere packing fraction at the transition, defining the transition
pressure or temperature by a cutoff in the diffusion constant, analogous to the
traditional laboratory definition of the glass transition by an arbitrary, low
cutoff in viscosity. The packing fraction at this transition point is not
constant, but is consistently higher for runs compressed at higher temperature.
We show that this is because the transition point defined by a constant cutoff
in the diffusion constant is not the same as the point of structural arrest, at
which further changes in pressure induce no further structural changes, but
that the two alternate descriptions may be reconciled by using a thermally
activated cutoff for the diffusion constant. This enables estimation of the

small for electronic properties of YBCO, and naturally mixes s- and d-pairing.
We examine available experiments to find a proportion of such a mixture. We

generating relatively strong gravity waves. The rays originating from the
pulsar experience a tiny periodic deflection due to the gravity waves produced
by the binary star. This deflection displaces the diffraction pattern laterally
in a manner that is familiar from refractive interstellar scintillation, except
that this gravity wave effect is not dispersive. The displacement has the same
period as the gravity waves. Its amplitude equals the product of the tiny
deflection angle and the large distance from the binary star to the observer.
This periodic displacement can reach a few hundred kilometers, which can be
comparable to the size of the features in the diffractive pattern. Thus, there

substantial, deterministic alteration of the scintillation time structure.

Though we know the form of the signal precisely, we will not know {\it a

a host of search templates each corresponding to different values of the
parameters. The number of search templates needed in detecting the Newtonian
waveform characterized by three independent parameters is itself several
thousands. With the inclusion of post-Newtonian corrections the inspiral
waveform will have four independent parameters and this, it was thought, would
lead to an increase in the number of filters by several orders of
magnitude---an unfavorable feature since it would drastically slow down data
analysis. In this paper I show that by a judicious choice of signal parameters
we can work, even when the first post-Newtonian corrections are included, with
as many number of parameters as in the Newtonian case. In other words I
demonstrate that the effective dimensionality of the signal parameter space

self-reproducing inflationary universe. We show that the main fraction of
volume of the universe in a state with a given density $\rho$ at any given
moment of time $t$ in synchronous coordinates is concentrated near the centers
of deep exponentially wide spherically symmetric holes in the density
distribution. A possible interpretation of this result is that a typical
observer should see himself living in the center of the world. Validity of this
interpretation depends on the choice of measure in quantum cosmology. Our
investigation suggests that unexpected (from the point of view of inflation)
observational data, such as possible local deviations from $\Omega = 1$, or
possible dependence of the Hubble constant on the length scale, may tell us
something important about quantum cosmology and particle physics at nearly
Planckian densities.

boundary hysteresis. We also discuss the rational limit, the $\XXX$ model.

The decomposition of the underlying Lie algebra with respect to an $SL(2)$

the appearance of a projective connection. Different $SL(2)$ embeddings lead to
various ${\cal W}$-gauge structures. We present a general soldering procedure
which allows to express zero curvature conditions for the ${\cal W}$-currents
in terms of conformally covariant differential operators acting on the ${\cal
W}$ gauge fields and to obtain, at the same time, the complete nilpotent BRS
differential algebra generated by ${\cal W}$-currents, gauge fields and the
ghost fields corresponding to ${\cal W}$-diffeomorphisms. As illustrations we
treat the cases of $SL(2)$ itself and to the two different $SL(2)$ embeddings
in $SL(3)$, {\it viz.} the ${\cal W}_3^{(1)}$- and ${\cal W}_3^{(2)}$-gauge
structures, in some detail. In these cases we determine algebraically ${\cal
W}$-anomalies as solutions of the consistency conditions and discuss their
Chern-Simons origin.

brainwashed by the great and tragic lives of Abel and Galois to believe that no
general formulas are possible for roots of equations higher than quartic. This
seemed to be confirmed by the brilliant and arduous solution of the general
quintic by Hermite. Yet, below we find a formula giving a root to any algebraic
equation of degree 2-5 and any reduced equation (see below) of higher degree.
This algorithm, which must have been familiar to Lagrange, resulted when I was

multiplication formula for the gamma function is used to reduce certain
infinite series, and by a happy accident my copy of Whittaker and Watson opened

subjected to electric and magnetic fields applied parallel to smectic layers.
The reversal of the electric field induces the motion of domain walls or fronts
that propagate into either an unstable or a metastable state. In both regimes,
the front velocity is calculated exactly. Depending on the field, the speed of
a front propagating into the unstable state is given either by the so-called
linear marginal stability velocity or by the nonlinear marginal stability
expression. The cross-over between these two regimes can be tuned by a magnetic
field. The influence of initial conditions on the velocity selection problem
can also be studied in such experiments. SmC$^*$ therefore offers a unique
opportunity to study different aspects of front propagation in an experimental
system.
