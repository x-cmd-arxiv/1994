distortion of faint background galaxies. We first describe how we locate the
galaxies and measure a 2-component `polarisation' or ellipticity statistic
$e_\alpha$ whose expectation value should be proportional to the gravitational
shear $\gamma_\alpha$. We then show that an anisotropic instrumental psf
perturbs the polarisation by $\delta e_\alpha = P^s_{\alpha\beta} p_\beta$,
where $p_\alpha$ is a measure of the psf anisotropy and $P^s_{\alpha\beta}$ is
the `linearised smear polarisability tensor'. By estimating $P^s_{\alpha\beta}$
for each object we can determine $p_\alpha$ from the foreground stars and apply
a correction $-P^s_{\alpha\beta}p_\beta$ to the galaxies. We test this
procedure using deep high-resolution images from HST which are smeared with an
anisotropic psf and then have noise added to simulate ground-based
observations. We find that the procedure works very well. A similar analysis
yields a linear shear polarisability tensor $P^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}$ which
describes the response to a gravitational shear. This calibrates the
polarisation-shear relation, but only for galaxies which are well resolved. To
empirically calibrate the effect of seeing on the smaller galaxies we
artificially stretch HST images to simulate lensing and then degrade them as
before. These experiments provide a rigorous and exacting test of the method
under realistic conditions. They show that it is possible to remove the effect
of instrumental psf anisotropy, and that the method provides an efficient and
quantitative measurement of the gravitational shear.

exist at all for a range of velocities starting at zero and ranging up to about
one quarter of the shear wave speed. Next it is shown that above this speed
cracks are by and large linearly stable, but that at sufficiently high velocity
they become unstable with respect to a nonlinear micro-cracking instability.
The way this instability works itself out is related to the scenario known as
intermittency, and the basic time scale which governs it is the inverse of the
amount of dissipation in the model. Finally, we compare the theoretical
framework with some new experiments in Plexiglas, and show that all qualitative

quasiparticle band observed at half filling simply cross the Fermi level and
reappear as the lowermost states of the inverse photoemission spectrum, while
the photoemission side of the band remains essentially unaffected. We discuss
problems in directly determining the Fermi surface from $n({\bf k})$ and make a
situation where they are largely avoided; we then find clear signatures of a
Fermi surface which takes the form of small hole pockets. The identical scaling
with $t/J$ of the quasiparticle weight $Z_h$ and difference in $n({\bf k})$
between neighboring ${\bf k}$-points suggests the existence of such a Fermi
surface in the physical regime of parameters. We construct spin-bag operators
which describe the holes dressed by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and
find that elementary electronic excitations of the system can be described well

rather conventional Fermi-liquid scenario with non-Luttinger Fermi surface, one
would explain many quasiparticle-relating properties of doped cuprates in a
very simple and natural way. We also show that the dynamical spin and charge
excitations deviate from the particle-hole excitations of this Fermi liquid:
e.g., the dominant low-energy spin excitation at momentum transfer $(\pi,\pi)$
reflects excitations of the incoherent spin background and is identified as a
collective mode comparable to spin waves in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

and elsewhere for the Standard Model and for new physics. A global fit to all
indirect precision data yields $m_t = 175 \pm 11^{+17}_{-19}$~GeV,
$\sin^2\theta_{MS} = 0.2317(3)(2)$, and $\alpha_s = 0.127(5)(2)$, where the
central values are for $M_H = 300$ GeV and the second uncertainties are for
$M_H \rightarrow 1000$ GeV (+) and 60 GeV (-). The $m_t$ value is in remarkable
agreement with the value $m_t=174 \pm 16$ GeV suggested by the CDF candidate
events. There is a slight preference for a light Higgs with $M_H < 730$ (880)
GeV at 95\% c.l. if the CDF $m_t$ value is (not) included. The sensitivity is,
however, due almost entirely to the anomalously large observed values for the
$Z \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ width and left-right asymmetry. The value of alpha_s
(from the lineshape) is clean theoretically assuming the Standard Model, but is
sensitive to the presence of new physics contributions to the $Z \rightarrow
b\bar{b}$ vertex. Allowing a vertex correction $\delta_{b\bar{b}}^{\rm new}$
one obtains the significantly lower value alpha_s = 0.111 \pm 0.009, in better
agreement with low energy determinations, and $\delta_{b\bar{b}}^{\rm new} =
0.023 \pm 0.011$. There is now enough data to perform more general fits to
parameters describing new physics effects and to separate these from $m_t$ and
$M_H$. Allowing the parameter $\rho_0$, which describes sources of $SU(2)$
breaking beyond the Standard Model, to be free one finds $\rho_0=1.0012 \pm
0.0017 \pm 0.0017$, remarkably close to unity. One can also separate the new
physics contributions to the oblique parameters $S_{\rm new}$, $T_{\rm new}$
and $U_{\rm new}$, which all take values consistent with zero. The effects of
supersymmetry on the determination of the SM parameters are discussed.

stuck in a false vacuum, followed by an epoch of `new inflation,' during which
the inflaton field slowly rolls toward its true minimum. During the first
epoch, inflation solves the smoothness and horizon problems. Then an open
universe (with negative spatial curvature) is created by the nucleation of a
single bubble. In effect $\Omega$ is instantaneously `reset' to zero. During
the subsequent `new' inflation $\Omega$ rises toward unity. The value of
$\Omega$ today is calculable in terms of the parameters of the potential, and
we show that obtaining values significantly different from zero or unity
(though within the range $0<\Omega <1$) does not require significant fine
tuning. We compute the spectrum of density perturbations by evolving the
Bunch-Davies vacuum modes across the bubble wall into its interior.
