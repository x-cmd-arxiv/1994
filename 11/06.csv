coupled area-preserving maps for many-coupled cases with $N>3$. It is found
that the critical scaling behaviors depend on the range of coupling
interaction. In the extreme long-range case of global coupling, in which each
area-preserving map is coupled to all the other area-preserving maps with equal
strength, there exist an infinite number of bifurcation routes in the parameter
plane, each of which ends at a critical point. The critical behaviors, which
vary depending on the type of bifurcation routes, are the same as those for the
previously-studied small $N$ cases $(N=2,3)$, independently of $N$. However,
for any other non-global coupling cases of shorter range couplings, there
remains only one bifurcation route ending at the zero-coupling critical point,
at which the $N$ area-preserving maps become uncoupled, The critical behavior
at the zero-coupling point is also the same as that for the small $N$ cases
$(N=2,3)$, independently of the coupling range.

$M$ is particularly investigated in the zero-coupling case in which the two 1D
maps become uncoupled. The zero-coupling fixed map of the $M$-furcation
renormalization transformation is found to have three relevant eigenvalues
$\delta$, $\alpha$, and $M$ ($\delta$ and $\alpha$ are the parameter and
orbital scaling factors of 1D maps, respectively). Here the second and third
ones, $\alpha$ and $M$, called the ``coupling eigenvalues'', govern the scaling
behavior associated with coupling, while the first one $\delta$ governs the
scaling behavior of the nonlinearity parameter like the case of 1D maps. The
renormalization results are also confirmed by a direct numerical method.

scattering arises solely due to the geometric nature of the problem. The band
formation in these geometric structures is analyzed and compared with the
conventional periodic potential scatterers. Some essential differences are
pointed out. We show that a single defect in an otherwise periodic structure
modifies band properties non trivially. By a proper choice of a single defect
one can produce positive energy bound states in continuum in the sense of von
Neumann and Wigner. We also discuss some magnetic properties of loop structures
in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm flux.

  Gravitational Fields","17 pp., compuscript LaTeX",,,"TP\94\219","gr-qc",,"  In Parts I and II of the work (gr-qc/9405013, 9407032), we have shown that
gravity is {\it sui generis} a Higgs field corresponding to spontaneous
symmetry breaking when the fermion matter admits only the Lorentz subgroup of
world symmetries of the geometric arena. From the mathematical viewpoint, the
Higgs nature of gravity issues from the fact that different gravitational
fields are responsible for nonequivalent representations of cotangent vectors
to a world manifold by $\gamma$-matrices on spinor bundles. It follows that
gravitational fields fail to form an affine space modelled on a linear space of
deviations of some background field. In other words, even weak gravitational
fields do not satisfy the superposition principle and, in particular, can not
be quantized by usual methods. At the same time, one can examine superposable
deviations $\sigma$ of a gravitational field $h$ so that $h+\sigma$ fails to be
a gravitational field. These deviations are provided with the adequate
mathematical description in the framework of the affine group gauge theory in
dislocated manifolds, and their Lagrangian densities differ from the familiar
gravitational ones. They make contribution to the standard gravitational
effects, e.g., modify Newton's gravitational potential.

by resumming exactly any number of one-loop vacuum polarization insertions into
one-loop diagrams. In this way, one makes maximal use of the information
contained in one-loop perturbative corrections combined with the one-loop
running of the effective coupling. The scale ambiguity at leading order is
converted into an intrinsic uncertainty of perturbative approximations induced
by IR renormalons. Practical implementation of this resummation requires only
knowledge of one-loop radiative corrections with non-vanishing gluon mass. We
find that higher order corrections to the pole mass and the top quark decay
width are dominated by renormalons already in low orders and demonstrate the
impact of eliminating the pole mass on the convergence of the perturbative
series.
