Invented less than ten years ago, the photo-injector the principle of which is
briefly recalled, has already demonstrated that it can provide very bright
beams. In this paper, the most advanced photo-injector projects are reviewed,
their specific features are outlined, and their major issues are examined. The
state-of-the-art in photocathode and laser technologies is presented. Beam
dynamics issues are also considered since they are essential in the production
of bright beams. Finally, the question of the maturity of photo-injector
technology is addressed.

symbiotic features present in radio loud and radio quiet quasars we scale the
bulk power of radio jets with the accretion power by adding mass- and energy
conservation of the whole jet-disk system to the standard Blandford \& K\""onigl
theory for compact radio cores. The model depends on only few parameters and
can be constrained by observations. Thus we are able to show that radio and
X-ray fluxes (SSC emission) of cores and lobes and typical dimensions of radio
loud quasars are consistent with a jet being produced in the central engine. We
present a synthetic broadband spectrum from radio to X-ray for a jet-disk
system. The only way to explain the high efficiency of radio loud objects is to
postulate that these objects consist of `maximal jets' with `total
equipartition' where the magnetic energy flow of the jet is comparable to the
kinetic jet power and the total jet power is a large fraction of the disk
power. As the number of electrons is limited by the accretion flow, this is
only possible when the minimum Lorentz factor of the electron distribution is
$\gamma_{\rm e,min}\ga100$ ($E\ga 50 {\rm MeV}$) or/and a large number of pairs
are present. Such an electron/positron population would be a necessary
consequence of hadronic interactions and may lead to some interesting effects
in the low frequency self-absorbed spectrum. Emission from radio weak quasars
can be explained with an initially identical jet. The difference between radio
loud and radio weak could be due to a different efficiency in accelerating
relativistic electrons on the sub-parsec scale. Finally we demonstrate that in
order to appease the ravenous hunger of radio loud jets its production must be
somehow linked to the dissipation process in the inner part of the disk.

the real and imaginary parts of $d_\tau^\gamma$, the electric dipole moment of
the $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for these ``vector correlations'' and the
standard deviation of the operators defining them due to standard model
interactions are presented for the two-body final states of $\tau$ decays. If
42\% average polarization of each beam is achieved, as proposed for the
tau-charm factories, with equal integrated luminosities for each sign of
polarization and a total yield of $2\cdot 10^7$ $\tau^+ \tau^-$ pairs, it is
possible to attain sensitivities for $\vert\delta {\rm Re}
d_{\tau}^{\gamma}\vert$ of $8\cdot 10^{-19}$, $1\cdot 10^{-19}$, $1\cdot

weak dipole form factor $d_\tau^Z$ are negligible as is the case when it is of
the same order of magnitude as $d_\tau^\gamma$. Furthermore, in such a
polarization experiment where different polarizations are possible, a
model-independent disentangling of their individual effects is possible, and a
technique to achieve this is described. A strong longitudinal polarization

that observables localized at the boundaries (edge observables) can occur in

connection of these observables to charge fractionation, vertex operators and
topological field theories is described. The edge observables, however, may or
may not exist as well-defined operators in a fully quantized theory depending
on the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and their momenta. The latter
are obtained by requiring the Hamiltonian of the theory to be self-adjoint and
positive definite. We show that these boundary conditions can also have nice
physical interpretations in terms of certain experimental parameters such as
the penetration depth of the electromagnetic field in a surrounding
superconducting medium. The dependence of the spectrum on one such parameter is
explicitly exhibited for the Higgs model on a spatial disc in its London limit.
It should be possible to test such dependences experimentally, the above Higgs
model for example being a model for a superconductor. Boundary conditions for
the 3+1 dimensional $BF$ system confined to a spatial ball are studied. Their
physical meaning is clarified and their influence on the edge states of this

imaginary-coupling affine Toda theories using the semi-classical method of
Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu. The theories divide naturally into those based on
the simply-laced, the twisted and the untwisted non-simply-laced algebras. We
find that the classical relationships between soliton and particle masses found
by Olive {\em et al.\ }persist for the first two classes, but do not appear to
do so naively for the third.

extreme domain walls in the presence of a dilaton field. The dilaton is a
scalar field without self-interaction that couples to the matter po- tential
that is responsible for the formation of the wall. Motivated by superstring and
supergravity theories, we consider both an exponential dilaton coupling
(parametrized with the coupling constant alpha and the case where the coupling
is self-dual, i.e. it has an extremum for a fi- nite value of the dilaton. For
an exponential dilaton coupling, extreme walls (which are static planar
configurations with surface energy density sigma_ext saturating the
corresponding Bogomol'nyi bound) have a naked (planar) singularity outside the
wall for alpha>1, while for alpha smaller or equal to 1 the singularity is
null. On the other hand, non-extreme walls (bubbles with two insides and
sigma_non > sigma_ext and ultra-extreme walls bubbles of false vacuum decay
with sigma_ultra < sigma_ext always have naked singularities. There are
solutions with self-dual couplings, which reduce to singularity-free vacuum
domain wall space--times. However, only non- and ultra-extreme walls of such a
type are dynamically stable.

on the nuclear equation of state in heavy ion collisions at energies that are
below the threshold for kaon production from the nucleon-nucleon interaction in
free space. For Au+Au collisions at 1 GeV/nucleon, we find that the kaon yield
measured by the Kaos collaboration at GSI can be accounted for if a soft
nuclear equation of state is used. We also confirm the results obtained in the
non-relativistic transport model that the dependence of kaon yield on the
nuclear equation of state is more appreciable in heavy ion collisions at lower
incident energies. We further clarify the difference between the predictions
from the relativistic transport model and the non-relativistic transport model
with a momentum-dependent potential.

from 12C to 208Pb. Assuming that for the quasifree process the cross sections
for pi/eta - photoproduction on a nucleon in medium are -- besides a lowering
due to Pauli blocking -- identical to those on a free nucleon, we use these as
an input. The produced mesons or resonances then propagate through the nucleus
where they can undergo several scattering and absorption processes. This final
state interaction, which leads to a lowering of the initial meson yield up to
70%, we simulate in a coupled channel Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport
model. It allows us to study in detail the influence of Fermi motion, Pauli
blocking and of the additional decay channels for nucleon resonances in medium
on the photoproduction cross section. The calculated total and differential
cross sections are compared to experimental data and the influence of the
different medium effects on the cross sections is discussed in detail.

by Weinberg is discussed. The important role of correlation effects and
explicit vector meson ($\rho$, $\omega$) exchange in the dynamics of
baryon-baryon interactions is demonstrated. As an example, the inclusion of the
exchange of a correlated pair of $\pi$ and $\rho$ meson between two nucleons
appears to be mandatory in order to resolve a long-standing puzzle concerning
the formfactor at the pion-nucleon-nucleon vertex.
