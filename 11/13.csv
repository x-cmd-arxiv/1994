  and Search for Coherent Periodicities","10 pages, uuencoded tar-compressed PostSript file, to appear on the
  Proceedings of the ""International Conference on Applications of Time Series
  Analysis in Astronomy and Meteorology"" (TSAM93). Send all comments,
  questions, requests, etc. to: israel@tsmi19.sissa.it",,,"Milano Series in Astrophysics N.136","astro-ph",,"  This paper summarises two recently developed techniques in power spectral
analysis and their application to a sample of X-ray light curves of accreting
collapsed objects in active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. The first
technique is designed to carry out detailed model fitting of continuum power
spectrum components arising from noise variability by using maximum likelihood
methods. The technique is applied to the light curves of a number of highly
variable AGNs observed with EXOSAT. Substantially steeper logarithmic power
spectrum slopes are obtained than previously estimated with standard methods.
The second technique was devised in order to reveal coherent periodicities in
the presence of ``coloured"" (i.e. non--white) noise variability components from
the source. To this aim the power spectra are searched for significant narrow
peaks superposed on the ``coloured"" continuum components. We present the
results of a search for an orbital modulation in the light curves of a sample
of 25 low mass X--ray binaries (LMXRBs), for which the orbital period is either
unknown or detected only at optical wavelengths. This led to the discovery of a
significant X--ray orbital modulation at the few percent level in the burster
MXB1636-539.

closed timelike curves (CTC's), in which all future-directed CTC's traverse one
end of a handle (wormhole) and emerge from the other end at an earlier time.
For a class of static geometries of this type, and for smooth initial data with
all derivatives in $L_2$ on ${\cI}^{-}$, we prove existence of smooth solutions
which are regular at null and spatial infinity (have finite energy and finite
$L_2$-norm) and have the given initial data on $\cI^-$. A restricted uniqueness
theorem is obtained, applying to solutions that fall off in time at any fixed
spatial position. For a complementary class of spacetimes in which CTC's are
confined to a compact region, we show that when solutions exist they are unique
in regions exterior to the CTC's. (We believe that more stringent uniqueness
theorems hold, and that the present limitations are our own.) An extension of
these results to Maxwell fields and massless spinor fields is sketched.
Finally, we discuss a conjecture that the Cauchy problem for free fields is
well defined in the presence of CTC's whenever the problem is well-posed in the
geometric-optics limit. We provide some evidence in support of this conjecture,
and we present counterexamples that show that neither existence nor uniqueness
is guaranteed under weaker conditions. In particular, both existence and
uniqueness can fail in smooth, asymptotically flat spacetimes with a compact
nonchronal region.
