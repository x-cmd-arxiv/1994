  Let $(M,L)$ be a smooth complex polarized threefold. Then the linear system
$| K+tL|$ separates any two different points on $M$ for any $t\ge 6$, where $K$
is the canonical bundle of $M$. The argument in the proof is a variant of
Ein-Lazarsfeld method. Although it is less powerful, it is cheaper, i.e., needs
fewer pages. Unfortunately, at present, I cannot show the very ampleness
because of technical difficulties. Some related topics are also discussed. A

possible to directly calibrate the effect of atmospheric seeing. Similar
experiments show that one can remove the effect of artificial image anisotropy
arising in the atmosphere or telescope. There have also been important advances
in the interpretation of the shear: reconstruction techniques have been
extended to encompass the strong distortion regime of giant arcs etc., progress

rotating, self-gravitating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric systems to derive
a new stability criterion for the appearance of toroidal, m=2 Intermediate (I)
and bar modes. In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar
systems and the m=2 I-modes in gaseous systems have many common physical
characteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy
of the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in
stellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability
criterion. The new stability parameter ""alpha"" is formulated first for
uniformly rotating systems and is based on the angular momentum content rather
than on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems
""alpha"" = 0.254-0.258, while it is in the range of 0.341-0.354 for gaseous
systems. For uniform rotation, one can write ""alpha"" as a function of the total
(rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is
characteristic of the topology/connectedness and the geometric shape of a
system. ""Alpha"" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of
differentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal
models whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known. We
also estimate ""alpha"" for gaseous toroidal models and for stellar disk systems
embedded in an inert or responsive ""halo"". We find that the new stability
criterion holds equally well for all these previously published axisymmetric
models.

instruments with good cross-calibration of their sensitivities. The range of
peak fluxes is increased by approximately a factor of 20 relative to the BATSE
catalog. Thus, more sensitive investigations of the $\log N-\log P$
distribution are possible. We place constraints on the width of the luminosity
function of gamma-ray bursts brighter than the BATSE completeness limit by
comparing the intensity distribution in the merged catalog with those produced
by a variety of spatial density and luminosity functions. For the models
examined, $90\%$ of the {\em detectable\/} bursts have peak luminosities within
a range of 10, indicating that the peak luminosities of gamma-ray bursts span a
markedly less wide range of values than many other of their measurable
properties. We also discuss for which slopes of a power-law luminosity function
the observed width is at the upper end of the constrained range. This is
important in determining the power-law slopes for which luminosity-duration

and $\x$ insertions compute Riemannian curvature and geodesic curvature
respectively. A proper definition of a CFT deformation induced by the dilaton
requires surface integrals of the dilaton and line integrals of $\x$.
Surprisingly, the ghost number anomaly makes this a trivial deformation. While
dilatons cannot deform conformal theories, they actually deform conformal
string backgrounds, showing in a simple context that a string background is not
necessarily the same as a CFT. We generalize the earlier proof of quantum
background independence of string theory to show that a dilaton shift amounts
to a shift of the string coupling in the field-dependent part of the quantum
string action. Thus the ``dilaton theorem'', familiar for on-shell string
amplitudes, holds off-shell as a consequence of an exact symmetry of the string
action.

in at least one member of F is the width of the family {U in F | x in U}. If F
has maximum width-degree at most k, then F is locally k-wide. Bounds on the
size of locally k-wide families of sets are established. If F is locally k-wide
and centered (every U in F has an element which does not belong to any member
of F incomparable to U), then |F| <= (k+1)(n-k/2); this bound is best possible.
Nearly exact bounds, linear in n and k, on the size of locally k-wide families
of arcs or segments are determined. If F is any locally k-wide family of sets,
then |F| is linearly bounded in n. The proof of this result involves an
analysis of the combinatorics of antichains. Let P be a poset and L a
semilattice (or an intersection-closed family of sets). The P-size of L is
|L^P|. For u in L, the P-density of u is the ratio |[u)^P|/|L^P|. The density
of u is given by the [1]-density of u. Let p be the number of filters of P. L
has the P-density property iff there is a join-irreducible a in L such that the
P-density of a is at most 1/p Which non-trivial semilattices have the P-density
property? For P=[1], it has been conjectured that the answer is: ""all"" (the
union-closed sets conjecture). Certain subdirect products of lower-semimodular
lattices and, for P=[n], of geometric lattices have the P-density property in a
strong sense. This generalizes some previously known results. A fixed lattice
has the [n]-density property if n is large enough. The density of a generator U
of a union-closed family of sets L containing the empty set is estimated. The
estimate depends only on the local properties of L at U. If L is generated by
sets of size at most two, then there is a generator U of L with estimated
density at most 1/2.

the sensitivity of the shell-gap sizes and the two-neutron separation energies
to the choice of particle-hole and particle-particle components of the
effective interaction is investigated.

  Short-Range Correlations","12 pages RevTeX, 7 figures postscript files appended",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.51.3040","TU 94-0811","nucl-th",,"  The influence of short-range correlations on the momentum and energy
distribution of nucleons in nuclei is evaluated assuming a realistic
meson-exchange potential for the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Using the
Green-function approach the calculations are performed directly for the finite
nucleus $^{16}$O avoiding the local density approximation and its reference to
studies of infinite nuclear matter. The nucleon-nucleon correlations induced by
the short-range and tensor components of the interaction yield an enhancement
of the momentum distribution at high momenta as compared to the Hartree-Fock
description. These high-momentum components should be observed mainly in
nucleon knockout reactions like $(e,e'p)$ leaving the final nucleus in a state
of high excitation energy. Our analysis also demonstrates that non-negligible
contributions to the momentum distribution should be found in partial waves
which are unoccupied in the simple shell-model. The treatment of correlations
beyond the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation also yields an improvement for
the calculated ground-state properties.
