reasons, based mainly on infrared radiative divergences, to believe that one

these two aspects within the concept of spatiotemporal complexity of dynamical

the nonexistence of a stable two- or three-line braid. This, and the high

structure which includes the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon
scattering. The model is based on a generalized effective-mass equation where a
nonlinear coupling is introduced to account for those inelastic scattering
phenomena. The nonlinear term depends on one parameter which is the only
constant in the model to be determined phenomenologically from experimental
data. As an example of the application of the model, we discuss
GaAs-Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$As double-barrier structures. When the nonlinear term is
considered, a sideband is observed at an energy of the order of the LO phonon
energy in GaAs in addition to and below the main transmission peak. Fitting of
the computed spectrum to known experimental results allows to find the value of
the nonlinear coupling. As a consequence, we can estimate the electron-phonon
coupling from the shift of the main transmission peak in comparison to the
linear resonant tunneling. We obtain good agreement with values coming from
more sophisticated treatments, which supports our claim that the nonlinear term
consistently includes electron-phonon effects. Finally, we use our simple model
to study magnitudes of interest for applications, namely $I-V$ characteristics,
which are shown to present two negative differential resistance peaks arising
from the main transmission peak and the sideband.

generically induce flavor-non-diagonal soft terms. Constraints from flavor
changing neutral currents (FCNC) and CP violation then require a large
supersymmtery breaking scale and thus heavy gluinos and squarks. If
Supersymmetry is broken by moduli $F$-terms, universality at the string tree
level can only be guaranteed by extra conditions on the K\""ahler potential. A
large hierarchy between the gluino and squark masses ensures that FCNC and CP
violation constraints are satisfied. If the soft scalar masses vanish at the

evaded. However, generic string loop corrections violate FCNC bounds and
require very heavy squark masses ($\approx 100\, TeV$).

possible measurements that might be conducted to give experimental data useful

yields information on the nature and relative distance of the source. We point
out that cosmological time dilation might be measured for these sources using
neutrinos, as has been done for photons, and that neutrino oscillation lengths
in the range of $1$ to $10^5~Mpc$ can be probed with GRB neutrinos. We thus
note that these sources may make possible the first non-electromagnetic
measurements of the scale size of the universe. We discuss tests of the weak
equivalence principle, tests for flavor dependent gravitational couplings, and
tests for long time scale variation of physical constants. We also show that a
number of new bounds on neutrino properties (charge, mass, speed, lifetime)
could be facilitated to levels well beyond those already inferred from the
neutrino observation of SN1987A. We also examine the implications of these
physics opportunities for designers of neutrino telescopes. We conclude that
detection may be possible in planned instruments if the spectra are power law

although finiteness of the complete functional integrals can be proven (details
are outlined in an Appendix). Therefore, although perhaps of limited usefulness
for numerical simulations, our scheme can be applied for studying aspects such
as analytic convergence questions, spontaneous symmetry breakdown and baryon
number violation in non-Abelian gauge theories.

models is studied on the two--sphere $S^{2}$. The conflict between the loss of
gauge invariance and global geometrical properties is solved by introducing a
fixed background connection. In this way the generalized Dirac--Weyl operator
can be globally defined on $S^{2}$. The generating functional of the Green
functions is obtained by taking carefully into account the contribution of
gauge fields with non--trivial topological charge and of the related
zero--modes of the Dirac determinant. In the decompactification limit, the
Green functions of the flat case are recovered; in particular the fermionic
condensate in the vacuum vanishes, at variance with its behaviour in the vector
Schwinger model.

that for the root system A_n-1 one can obtain Macdonald's polynomials - a new
interesting class of symmetric functions recently defined by I. Macdonald {M1]

finite-dimensional representations of U_q sl_n. The main goal of the present
paper is to use this construction to give a representation-theoretic proof of
Macdonald's inner product and symmetry identities for the root system A_n-1.
Macdonald's inner product identities (see [M2]) have been proved by
combinatorial methods my Macdonald ([Macdonald, private communication]).

current deep inelastic (anti-) neutrino scattering on protons and neutrons is
calculated as a function of the Bjorken $x$ and the proton momentum. The
standard hadronization models based upon the colour neutralization mechanism
appear to underestimate the rate of slow proton production on hydrogen. The
presence of the virtual mesons (pions) in the nucleon leads to an additional
mechanism for proton production, referred to as spectator process. It is found
that at low proton momenta both mechanisms compete, whereas the spectator
mechanism dominates at very small momenta, while the color neutralization
mechanism dominates at momenta larger than 1-2 \, GeV$/c$. The results of the
calculations are compared with the CERN bubble chamber (BEBC) data. The
spectator model predicts a sharp increase of the semi-inclusive cross section
at small $x$ due to the sea quarks in virtual mesons.
