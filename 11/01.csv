Ker[Pic(A) --> Pic(B)]. Let k be a field and assume that A is a f.g. k-algebra.
  We prove a number of finiteness results for D(A,B). Here are four of them.
  1: Suppose B is a f.g. and faithfully flat A-algebra which is geometrically
integral over k. If k is perfect, we find that D(A,B) is f.g. (In positive
characteristic, we need resolution of singularities to prove this.) For an
arbitrary field k of positive characteristic p, we find that modulo p-power
torsion, D(A,B) is f.g.
  2: Suppose B = A tensor k^sep. We find that D(A,B) is finite.
  3: Suppose B = A tensor L, where L is a finite, purely inseparable extension.
We give examples to show that D(A,B) may be infinite.
  4: Assuming resolution of singularities, we show that if K/k is any algebraic
extension, there is a finite extension E/k contained in K/k such that D(A
tensor E,A tensor K) is trivial.
  The remaining results are absolute finiteness results for Pic(A).
  5: For every n prime to char(k), Pic(A) has only finitely many elements of
order n.
  6: Structure theorems are given for Pic(A), in the case where k is absolutely
f.g.

a Ly$\alpha$ forest continuum break and a continuum break at

roughly aligned with the radio source. The galaxy shows a double structure in
the $I$-band ($\lambda_{rest}\approx$1500\AA) which is aligned with the radio
axis; the two $I$-band components spatially coincide with the nuclear and
southern radio components. Some fraction of the $I$ band emission could be due
to a nonthermal process such as inverse compton scattering. In the $K$-band

galaxy has a very low surface brightness, diffuse morphology. The $K$
morphology shows little relationship to the radio source structure, although
the major axis of the $K$ emission is elongated roughly in the direction of the
radio source axis. The galaxian continuum is very red ($I-K>4$) and if the $K$

  Linda Bauman Peto
  Department of Computer Science
  University of Toronto Abstract Word bigram models estimated from text corpora
require smoothing methods to estimate the probabilities of unseen bigrams. The
deleted estimation method uses the formula:
  Pr(i|j) = lambda f_i + (1-lambda)f_i|j, where f_i and f_i|j are the relative
frequency of i and the conditional relative frequency of i given j,
respectively, and lambda is an optimized parameter. MacKay (1994) proposes a
Bayesian approach using Dirichlet priors, which yields a different formula:
  Pr(i|j) = (alpha/F_j + alpha) m_i + (1 - alpha/F_j + alpha) f_i|j where F_j
is the count of j and alpha and m_i are optimized parameters. This thesis
describes an experiment in which the two methods were trained on a
two-million-word corpus taken from the Canadian _Hansard_ and compared on the
basis of the experimental perplexity that they assigned to a shared test
corpus. The methods proved to be about equally accurate, with MacKay's method
using fewer resources.

strongly supports the conjecture that in general instable perturbations grow
