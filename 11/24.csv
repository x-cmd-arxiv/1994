the radio core emission of a quasar sample. In a radio/$L_{\rm disk}$ plot we
find the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars
(CDQ), lobe dominated quasars (LDQ), radio-intermediate quasars (RIQ) and radio
weak quasars. In general the radio core emission scales with the disk
luminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. This shows that radio and UV
emission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loud
and radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. We investigate the
possibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission in
radio loud and radio weak quasars. Comparing our data with a simple jet
emission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation in
a coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry a
total power $Q_{\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity
$L_{\rm disk}$. For the electron population one is forced to postulate an
efficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electrons
with a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 MeV -- secondary pair
production in hadronic cascades could be such a process. The bulk Lorentz
factor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\la\gamma_{\rm j}\la10$)).
The radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the same
parameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, as
suggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. There is evidence that RIQ are the
relativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. We can estimate
the hidden disk luminosity of FR II galaxies and find that this is consistent
with FRII being misdirected quasars.

time-dependent solutions linked to an other kind of the third Painlev\'e

and of relations between various Yukawa couplings (assuming the supersymmetri

detail. Theoretical uncertainties in the calculations are emphasized, and
low-energy constraints and predictions are derived. In particular, we find that
bottom-tau unification favors a Higgs boson lighter than 110 GeV. The structure
of the vacuum in the model studied is also discussed. Implications of embedding
supersymmetric models in grand-unified theories are further explored and are
shown to affect the soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters of the models,

Standard Model of CP violation, which is based on a complex phase in the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. Three kinds of CP nonconservation are
studied: In $B^0-\Bbar$ mixing, in mixed neutral $B$ decays to states which are
common decay products of $B^0$ and $\Bbar$ and in direct decays of charged $B$
mesons. Measurements of certain CP asymmetries are shown to determine the three
angles of the CKM unitarity triangle. $\beta$ is measured cleanly in
$B^0\to\psi K_S$. Uncertainties due to penguin amplitudes in the determination
of $\alpha$ using the asymmetry in $B^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$ (or $B^0 \to
\rho^+\pi^-$) can be eliminated (or in the worst case only estimated) by
relating the rate of this process to decay rates involving other two light
pseudoscalars. The angle $\gamma$ can be measured in charged $B$ decays,
provided that color suppression in $B\to DK$ (or $B\to DK_i(1400)$) is not too
strong and/or that certain rescattering effects in $B$ decays to two light

(which is the norm-closure of the inductive limit $\cup_k U(k)$) of unitary
operators on a separable Hilbert space $\H$, which were found by Kirillov and
Ol'shanskii, are reconstructed from quantization theory. Firstly, the coadjoint
orbits of this group are realized as Marsden-Weinstein symplectic quotients in
the setting of dual pairs. Secondly, these quotients are quantized on the basis
of the author's earlier proposal to quantize a more general symplectic
reduction procedure by means of Rieffel induction (a technique in the theory of
operator algebras). As a warmup, the simplest such orbit, the projective
Hilbert space, is first quantized using geometric quantization, and then again
with Rieffel induction. Reduction and induction have to be performed with
either $U(M)$ or $U(M,N)$. The former case is straightforward, unless the
half-form correction to the (geometric) quantization of the unconstrained
system is applied. The latter case, in which one induces from holomorphic
discrete series representations, is problematic. For finite-dimensional
$\H=\C^k$, the desired result is only obtained if one ignores half-forms, and
induces from a representation, `half' of whose highest weight is shifted by $k$
(relative to the naive orbit correspondence). This presumably poses a problem
for any theory of quantizing constrained systems.

"hep-th/9411172","Nicholas Landsman","N.P. Landsman","Classical and quantum representation theory","LaTeX, 40 pages",,,,"hep-th quant-ph",,"  These notes present an introduction to an analytic version of deformation
quantization. The central point is to study algebras of physical observables
and their irreducible representations. In classical mechanics one deals with
real Poisson algebras, whereas in quantum mechanics the observables have the
structure of a real non-associative Jordan-Lie algebra. The non-associativity
is proportional to $\pl^2$, hence for $\pl\raw 0$ one recovers a real Poisson
algebra. This observation lies at the basis of `strict' deformation
quantization, where one deforms a given Poisson algebra into a $C^*$-algebra,
in such a way that the basic algebraic structures are preserved. Our main
interest lies in degenerate Poisson algebras and their quantization by
non-simple Jordan-Lie algebras. The traditional symplectic manifolds of
classical mechanics, and their quantum counterparts (Hilbert spaces and
operator algebras which act irreducibly) emerge from a generalized
representation theory. This two-step procedure sheds considerable light on the
subject. We discuss a large class of examples, in which the Poisson algebra
canonically associated to an (integrable) Lie algebroid is deformed into the
Jordan-Lie algebra of the corresponding Lie groupoid. A special case of this
construction, which involves the gauge groupoid of a principal fibre bundle,
describes the classical and quantum mechanics of a particle moving in an
external gravitational and Yang-Mills field.

`objectification' or `measurement' in quantum mechanics which are based on
superselection rules. Such approaches venture to derive the emergence of
classical `reality' relative to a class of observers; those believing that the
classical world exists intrinsically and absolutely are advised against reading
this paper. The prototype approach (Hepp) where superselection sectors are
assumed in the state space of the apparatus is shown to be untenable. Instead,
one should couple system and apparatus to an environment, and postulate
superselection rules for the latter. These are motivated by the locality of any
observer or other (actual or virtual) monitoring system. In this way
`environmental' solutions to the measurement problem (Zeh, Zurek) become
consistent and acceptable, too. Points of contact with the modal interpretation
are briefly discussed. We propose a minimal value attribution to observables in
theories with superselection rules, in which only central observables have
properties. In particular, the eigenvector-eigenvalue link is dropped. This is
mainly motivated by Ockham's razor.

theory, which is carried through in detail for electro- magnetism. Starting
from the so-called Fermi representation of the field algebra generated by the
free abelian gauge field, we construct a new (`rigged') sesquilinear form on
the representation space, which is positive semi-definite, and given in terms
of a Gaussian weak distribution (promeasure) on the gauge group (taken to be a
Hilbert Lie group). This eventually constructs the algebra of observables of
