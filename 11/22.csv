transition in the inner Galaxy ($R \simeq 3-8 \kpc$). The model used takes into
account emission from a large path length along the line of sight,
corresponding to an interval ($\Delta R$) of typically $\le 1 \kpc$ in galactic
radius; and is parametrized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z,
the rotation velocity and the velocity dispersion. These parameters are assumed
to be constant over the interval $\Delta R$. This modeling is carried out for
the 21 cm surveys of Weaver \& Williams(1974), Bania \& Lockman (1984), and
Kerr et al. (1986) to measure these parameters. The terminal velocity values
are found to be in good agreement with previous measurements. The velocity
dispersion is constant with radius at the theoretically expected value of $9
\pm 1 \kms$. The Gaussian scale height of the HI layer increases with
Galactocentric radius. The centroid of the layer deviates significantly from
$z=0$. Apart from small local variations, the velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$,
scale height $\sigma_z$ and the centroid $z_0$ show similar variations in the
first and the fourth quadrants. On balancing the turbulent pressure support of
the layer against the disk gravitational potential, we confirm that additional
support is needed for the HI layer. The radial profile of the reduced midplane
mass density is an exponential with a scale length of $3.3 \pm 0.3 \kpc$. This
picture is consistent with a constant mass-to-light ratio of the disk, and
extra pressure support for the HI layer which is constant with radius in the

scattering are more sensitive than detectors relying on incoherrent

there are complete subalgebras of Cohen algebras which are not Cohen

the model(s) of exact learning by (extended) equivalence and membership
queries. Polynomial-time learning algorithms are described for vertex covers,
independent sets, and dominating sets. The complexity of learning vertex sets
of fixed size is also investigated, and it is shown that the k-element vertex
covers in a graph can be learned in a number of rounds of interaction that is
independent of the size of the graph. Apart from the elegance of these
algorithmic problems, the chief motivation is the surprising recently
established connection between the important unsolved problem of the learning
complexity of CNF (or DNF) formulas and the learning complexity of dominating
sets. The complexity of teaching sets of vertices in graphs is also considered.

potential energy surface (PES) is obtained from density functional theory
calculations. Two regimes of dynamics are found, at low energies sticking is
determined by the minimum energy barrier, at high energies by the distribution
of barrier heights. Experimental results are well-reproduced qualitatively, but
some quantitative discrepancies are identified as well.

within realistic meson-exchange models of the $\pi\pi$ and $\pi\eta$
interactions. Starting from a modified version of the J\""ulich model for
$\pi\pi$ scattering we perform an analysis of the pole structure of the
resulting scattering amplitude and find, in contrast to existing models, a
somewhat large mass for the $f_0(975)$ ($m_{f_0}=1015$ MeV, $\Gamma_{f_0}=30$
MeV). It is shown that our model provides a description of
$J/\psi\rightarrow\phi\pi\pi/\phi KK$ data comparable in quality with those of
alternative models. Furthermore, the formalism developed for the $\pi\pi$
system is consistently extended to the $\pi\eta$ interaction leading to a
description of the $a_0(980)$ as a dynamically generated threshold effect
(which is therefore neither a conventional $q\overline{q}$ state nor a
$K\overline{K}$ bound state). Exploring the corresponding pole position the
$a_0(980)$ is found to be rather broad ($m_{a_0}=991$ MeV, $\Gamma_{a_0}=202$
MeV). The experimentally observed smaller width results from the influence of
the nearby $K\overline{K}$ threshold on this pole.
