  PostScript; 3 figures included",,"10.1086/176280","SUSB0194","astro-ph",,"  Local nonlinear approximations to the growth of cosmic perturbations are
developed, resulting in relations, at a given epoch, between the peculiar
velocity and gravity fields and their gradients. Only the equation of motion is
approximated, while mass conservation and the computation of the gravitational
field are treated exactly. The second-order relation is derived for arbitrary
geometry and cosmological parameters. Solutions are developed to fourth order
for laminar spherical perturbations in an Einstein-de Sitter universe, but the
gain in accuracy for higher orders is modest. All orders become comparable when
the peculiar kinetic energy per unit mass equals the peculiar potential,
typically at relative density perturbations, $\delta \sim 4$. The general
second-order relation, while implicit, is simple to solve. \nbody\ simulations
show that it provides moderate gains in accuracy over other local
approximations. It can therefore be easily applied in the comparison of
large-scale structures and velocities in the quasi-linear regime, $\delta \sim
1 - 4$, as well as in the reconstruction of the primordial perturbations from
which they grew.

The

includes the so-called Miras and OH/IR stars. In this review I will discuss the
characteristics and evolution of especially Miras, and discuss how they are
linked to the mass loss. There are indications that high mass-loss rates are
only reached for relatively young stars with massive progenitors. The mass loss
rates vary both on long and short time scales: the short-term variations are
likely linked to luminosity variations associated with the thermal-pulse cycle.
The influence of mass loss in the post-AGB phase is also discussed.

literature data, our redshift sample is 95~\% complete up to a magnitude
b$_{26.5}$=18.0 (the magnitudes are taken from the photometric sample of Godwin
et al. 1983). Using redshift-confirmed membership for 205 galaxies, and the
location in the colour-magnitude diagram for another 91 galaxies, we have built
a sample of cluster members which is complete up to b$_{26.5}$=20.0. We show
that the Coma cluster luminosity function cannot be adequately fitted by a
single Schechter (1976) function, because of a dip in the magnitude
distribution at b$_{26.5}$$\sim$17. The superposition of an Erlang (or a Gauss)
and a Schechter function provides a significantly better fit. We compare the
luminosity function of Coma to those of other clusters, and of the field.
Luminosity functions for rich clusters look similar, with a maximum at $M_{b}
\simeq -19.5 + 5 \times \log h_{50}$, while the Virgo and the field luminosity
functions show a nearly monotonic behaviour. These differences may be produced
by physical processes related to the environment which affect the luminosities

and T_1 photometry for 143 globular cluster candidates with an expected
contamination of no more than 10%. We find that the color distribution of the
NGC 3923 globular cluster system (GCS) is broad and appears to have at least
two peaks. A mixture modeling analysis of the color distribution indicates that
a two component model is favored over a single component one at a high level of
confidence (>99%). This evidence for more than one population in the GCS of NGC
3923 is similar to that previously noted for the four other elliptical galaxies
for which similar data have been published. Furthermore, we find that the NGC
3923 GCS is redder than the GCSs of previously studied elliptical galaxies of
similar luminosity. The median metallicity inferred from our (C-T_1)_0 colors
is [Fe/H]_{med} = -0.56, with an uncertainty of 0.14 dex arising from all
sources of uncertainty in the mean color. This is more metal rich than the
median metallicity found for the GCS of M87 using the same method, [Fe/H]_{med}
= -0.94. Since M87 is more luminous than NGC 3923, this result points to
significant scatter about any trend of higher GCS metallicity with increasing
galaxy luminosity. We also show that there is a color gradient in the NGC 3923
GCS corresponding to about -0.5 dex in Delta[Fe/H]\Delta(log r). We conclude
that the shape of the color distribution of individual GCSs and the variation
in mean color among the GCSs of ellipticals are difficult to understand if
elliptical galaxies are formed in a single protogalactic

relations for the relative coefficients of these polynomials. For two submodels
of the XYZ chain - namely the XXX and XY cases, all the charges can be
calculated in closed form. For the XXX case, a simple description of conserved
charges is found in terms of a Catalan tree. This construction is generalized
for the su(M) invariant integrable chain. We also indicate that a quantum
recursive (ladder) operator can be traced back to the presence of a hamiltonian
mastersymmetry of degree one in the classical continuous version of the model.
We show that in the quantum continuous limits of the XYZ model, the ladder
property of the boost operator disappears. For the Hubbard model we demonstrate
the non-existence of a ladder operator. Nevertheless, the general structure of
