--> S be a minimal resolution of singularities. A set N of nodes on S is EVEN
if there exists a divisor Q on S~ such that 2Q ~ pi^{-1}(N).
  Suppose that S has degree 6. It is known (Basset) that S cannot have 67 or
more nodes. It is also known (Barth) that S can have 65 nodes. It is not known
if S can have 66 nodes. Likewise, it is not known exactly what sizes can occur
for an even set of nodes on S.
  We show that an nonempty even set of nodes on S must have size 24, 32, 40,
56, or 64. We do not know if the sizes 56 and 64 can occur. We show that if S
has 66 nodes, then it must have an even set of 64 nodes, and it cannot have an
even set of 56 nodes. THUS IF ONE COULD RULE OUT THE CASE OF A 64 NODE EVEN
SET, IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT S CANNOT HAVE 66 NODES.
  The existence or nonexistence of large even node sets is related to the
following vanishing problem. Let S be a normal surface of degree s in CP^3. Let
D be a Weil divisor on S such that D is Q-rationally equivalent to rH, for some
r \in \Q. Under what circumstances do we have H^1(O_S(D)) = 0? For instance,
this holds when r < 0. For s=4 and r=0, H^1 can be nonzero. For s=6 and r=0, if
a 56 or 64 node even set exists, then H^1 can be nonzero. The vanishing of H^1
is also related to linear normality, quadric normality, etc. of set-theoretic
complete intersections in P^3. Hard copy is available from the author. E-mail

anomalous cepheid was identified. We discovered also two variables located at
the tip of the red giant branch of Sculptor. Out of 226 RR Lyr variables 135
were classified as RRab, 88 as RRc and 2 as RRd. Distribution of periods for
RRab stars shows a sharp cut-off at P=0.475 days. This implies that the bulk of
Sculptor RR Lyr stars has metallicity [Fe/H]\leq -1.7 on the Zinn-West scale.
The average V magnitudes of RRab variables are correlated with their periods.
This effect is most probably caused by the spread of metallicities exhibited by
variables. Based on the average V magnitudes of RR Lyr stars the apparent
distance modulus of Sculptor was determined at (m-M)_{V}=19.71. The
color-magnitude diagram of Sculptor reaching V\approx 21.4 and I\approx 20.6 is

low Hubble constant ($h=0.3$) CDM. We compare simulations with an Abell/ACO

the real data sets are the Cold + Hot DM model and the CDM model with a
cosmological constant. The probability density function of all models and data
is always well approximated by a lognormal distribution. We also find that the
linear biasing parameter for the simulated clusters is nearly constant over a
large range of scales, but its value depends on the model. We also note that
the abundances of clusters predicted by the Press-Schechter theory provide
strong constraints on these models: only the Cold + Hot DM model and the low-H
CDM model appear to produce the correct number-density of clusters. Taking this
constraint together with the cluster clustering statistics leads one to
conclude that the best of our models is the Cold + Hot DM scenario.

hierarchy where a feature structure has only one unique most general type, and
multiple inheritance involves computation of greatest lower bounds in the
hierarchy. The proposed approach supports current linguistic analyses in
constraint-based formalisms like HPSG, inheritance in the lexicon, and
knowledge representation for NLP systems. Finally, we show that
multi-dimensional inheritance hierarchies can be compiled into a Prolog term
representation, which allows to compute the conjunction of two types

dielectric medium. The nuclear recoil energies deposited in the SSG were
determined measuring the neutron scattering angles with a neutron hodoscope.
Coincidences in time between the SSG and the hodoscope signals have been
clearly established. In this paper the results of the neutron irradiation
experiments at different SSG intrinsic thresholds are discussed and compared to

energies down to $\sim$1keV. The limited angular resolution of the neutron

perturbation theory. In the symmetric phase a non-perturbative vector boson
mass is generated by the non-abelian gauge interactions, whose value is rather
independent of the scalar self-coupling $\lambda$. For small values of

is a special case of a twist. The most familiar example of a deformation
produced from a UDF is perhaps the ""Moyal product"" which (locally) is the
canonical quantization of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold in
the direction of the Poisson bracket. In this case, the derivations comprising
the Poisson bracket mutually commute and so this quantization is essentially
obtained by exponentiating this bracket. For more general Poisson manifolds,
this formula is not applicable since the associated derivations may no longer
commute. We provide here generalizations of the Moyal formula which (locally)
give canonical quantizations of various Poisson manifolds. Specifically,
whenever a certain central extension of a Heisenberg Lie group acts on a

the help of the so-called Anderson-Duchamp-Krupka equations. For the case of
second order equations and a scalar field we establish a polynomial structure
in the second order derivatives. This structure can be used to make more
precise the form of a general symmetry. As an illustration we analyse the case
of Lagrangian equations with Poincar\'e invariance or with universal
invariance.

determine ideal membership and compute syzygies. The main goal is to present

an application, we will produce a method for computing generators for the first
syzygy module of a subset of an $R$-subalgebra of $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ where
each coordinate of each syzygy must be an element of the subalgebra.

of a network to all other nodes. This task is accomplished by placing a series
of calls over the communication lines of the network between neighboring nodes,
where each call requires a unit of time and a call can involve only two nodes.
We show that for bounded-degree networks determining the minimum broadcast time
from an originating node remains NP-complete.

  figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.52.13236",,"mtrl-th cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  A systematic method is presented for constructing effective Hamiltonians for
general phonon-related structural transitions. The key feature is the
application of group theoretical methods to identify the subspace in which the
effective Hamiltonian acts and construct for it localized basis vectors, which
are the analogue of electronic Wannier functions. The results of the symmetry
analysis for the perovskite, rocksalt, fluorite and A15 structures and the
forms of effective Hamiltonians for the ferroelectric transition in $PbTiO_3$
and $BaTiO_3$, the oxygen-octahedron rotation transition in $SrTiO_3$, the
Jahn-Teller instability in $La_{1-x}(Ca,Sr,Ba)_xMnO_3$ and the
antiferroelectric transition in $PbZrO_3$ are discussed. For the oxygen-
octahedron rotation transition in $SrTiO_3$, this method provides an
alternative to the rotational variable approach which is well behaved
throughout the Brillouin zone. The parameters appearing in the Wannier basis
vectors and in the effective Hamiltonian, given by the corresponding invariant
energy expansion, can be obtained for individual materials using first-
principles density-functional-theory total energy and linear response
techniques, or any technique that can reliably calculate force constants and
distortion energies. A practical approach to the determination of these
parameters is presented and the application to ferroelectric $PbTiO_3$
discussed.

effects are estimated by comparison to a nonrelativistic model, where we use
simple basis states to represent the baryon wavefunctions. Sizeable
relativistic effects are found for certain transitions, for example, to radial
excitations such as that conventionally used to describe to the Roper
resonance. A systematic study shows that the violation of rotational covariance
of the baryon transition matrix elements stemming from the use of one-body

current (PCAC) relationship and corresponding current algebra results in two
strongly correlated directions: 1) towards a search for a set of systematic
rules for the establishment of PCAC related relationships in a finite low
momentum transfer region and for the extrapolation of the momentum transfer
$q^2$ to zero when deriving the low energy PCAC results that can be compared to
experimental data and 2) towards taking into account, besides the conventional
one, the only other possibility of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking,
$SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \to SU(2)_V$, inside a baryonic system by a condensation
(in the sense to be specified in the paper) of diquarks. The paper includes
investigations of a chiral Ward--Takahashi identity, the explicit chiral
symmetry breaking by a finite current quark mass, the modification of the PCAC
relationship and its consequences. It is shown that the signals for a
hypothetical diquark condensation inside a nucleon and nucleus is observable in
high precision experiments despite the fact that they may evade most of the
current observations. We briefly discuss how diquark condensation could provide
an answer to the question of where about of pions and quark number in a nucleon
and a nucleus, which is raised in explaining puzzles in polarized pion nucleus
scattering, violation of Gottfried sum rule and EMC effects.
