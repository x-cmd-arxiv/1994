different spatial resolution overlaid subsequently, which enables us to trace
the evolution from the molecular cloud density $\sim 100 {\rm cm}^{-3}$ to that
of the protostellar disk $\sim 10^{10} {\rm cm} ^{-3}$ or more. Fluctuation
with small amplitude grows by the gravita- tional instability. It forms a disk
perpendicular to the magnetic fields which runs in the direction parallel to
the major axis of the cloud. Matter accrets on to the disk mainly flowing along
the magnetic fields and this makes the column density increase. The radial
inflow, whose velocity is slower than that perpendicular to the disk, is driven
by the increase of the gravity. While the equation of state is isothermal and
magnetic fields are perfectly coupled with the matter, which is realized in the
density range of $\rho \lesssim 10^{10} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, never stops the
contraction. The structure of the contracting disk reaches that of a singular
solution as the density and the column density obey $\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ and
$\sigma(r) \propto r^{-1}$, respectively. The magnetic field strength on the
mid-plane is proportional to $\rho(r)^{1/2}$ and further that of the center
($B_c$) evolves as proportional to the square root of the gas density ($\propto
\rho_c^{1/2}$). It is shown that isothermal clouds experience ``run-away''
collapses. The evolution after the equation of state becomes hard is also

fermions to gravity. The Standard Model based upon
$SU(3){\times}SU(2){\times}{U(1)}$ which has 15 fermions per generation is
shown to be inconsistent if all background spin manifolds with signature
invariant $\tau=8k$ are allowed. Similarly, GUTs based on odd number of Weyl
fermions are inconsistent. Consistency can be achieved by adding an extra Weyl
fermion which needs to couple only to gravity. For arbitrary $\tau$'s,
generalized spin structures are needed, and the global anomaly cancellation
requires that the net index of the total Dirac operator with spin and internal
gauge connections be even. As a result GUTs with fundamental multiplets which
contain multiples of 16 Weyls per generation are selected. The simplest
consistent GUT is the SO(10) model with a multiplet of 16 Weyls per generation.
The combined gravity and internal symmetry gauge group of the theory is then
$[Spin(3,1){\times}Spin(10)]/Z_2$. Physical implications of these results are
commented on.

satisfied by the creation and annihilation operators $a^{\dagger}$ and $a$ of a
harmonic oscillator. A hermitian phase operator, which inevitably leads to
$dim\ ker\ a^{\dagger}a - dim\ ker\ aa^{\dagger} = 0$, cannot be consistently
defined. If one considers an $s+1$ dimensional truncated theory, a hermitian
phase operator of Pegg and Barnett which carries a vanishing index can be
defined. However, for arbitrarily large $s$, we show that the vanishing index
of the hermitian phase operator of Pegg and Barnett causes a substantial
deviation from minimum uncertainty in a characteristically quantum domain with
small average photon numbers. We also mention an interesting analogy between
the present problem and the chiral anomaly in gauge theory which is related to
the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. It is suggested that the phase operator
problem related to the above analytic index may be regarded as a new class of
quantum anomaly. From an anomaly view point ,it is not surprising that the
phase operator of Susskind and Glogower, which carries a unit index, leads to
an anomalous identity and an anomalous commutator.

by measuring the parametrised post Newtonian parameters. Two such parameters
$\beta$ and $\gamma$, equal to one in Einstein theory, can be obtained from
static spherically symmetric solutions. For the graviton-dilaton system, as in
Brans-Dicke or low energy string theory, we find that if $\gamma \ne 1$ for a
charge neutral point star, then there exist naked singularities. Thus, if
$\gamma$ is measured to be different from one, then it cannot be explained by
these theories, without implying naked singularities. We also couple a
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the graviton-dilaton system, a la string
theory. We find that static spherically symmetric solutions in low energy
string theory, which describe the gravitational field of a point star in the
real universe atleast upto a distance $r_* \simeq {\cal O} ({\rm pc})$, always
lead to curvature singularities. These singularities are stable and much worse
than the naked ones. Requiring their absence upto a distance $r_*$ implies a
bound $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 102} (\frac{r_*}{{\rm pc}})^{- 2}$ in natural units.
If $r_* \simeq 1 {\rm Mpc}$ then $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 114}$, and if $r_*$
