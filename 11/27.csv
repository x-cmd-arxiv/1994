probability theory and not from the usual viewpoint of a particular model. By
using the perspective of probability theory, we detail the nature of a cluster
algorithm, make explicit the assumptions embodied in all clusters of which we
are aware, and define the construction of free cluster algorithms. We also
illustrate these procedures by rederiving the Swendsen-Wang algorithm,
presenting the details of the loop algorithm for a worldline simulation of a
quantum $S=$ 1/2 model, and proposing a free cluster version of the
Swendsen-Wang replica method for the random Ising model. How the principle of
maximum entropy might be used to aid the construction of cluster algorithms is
also discussed.

displacements from equilibrium positions has been fitted for different Gamma

Gamma phonons have been calculated in the harmonic approximation, and in the
quantum oscillator scheme -- for A2 and B2 modes. The microscopic structure of
the orthorhombic phase has been analyzed in a series of supercell calculations
for different patterns of Nb displacements, providing indications in favour of
the chain structure, with oppositely directed neighboring chains.

we obtain lower bounds from stability requirements: they depend on the top mass
and the cutoff scale. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model we obtain
upper bounds which depend on the top mass and the scale of supersymmetry
breaking. A Higgs mass measurement could discriminate, depending on the top
mass, between the two models. Higgs discovery at LEP-200 can put an upper bound
on the scale of new physics.

spherically-symmetric, asymptotically flat string spacetimes in four
dimensions, where the dilaton, axion, metric, and gauge fields are allowed to
be nonzero. Independent of the alpha' expansion, there is a six-parameter
family of such configurations, labelled by the charges characterizing the
asymptotic behaviour of the various fields: ie their mass, dilaton charge,
axion charge, electric charge, magnetic charge, and Taub-NUT parameter. We show
that duality, based on time-translation invariance, maps these solutions
amongst themselves, with the effect of interchanging two pairs of these six
labels, namely: (1) the mass and dilaton charge, and (2) the axion charge and
the Taub-NUT parameter. We consider in detail the special case of the purely
Schwarzschild black hole, for which the mass of the dual configuration vanishes
to leading order in alpha'. Working to next-to-leading order in alpha' for the
bosonic and heterotic strings, we find that duality takes a black hole of mass
M to a (singular) solution having mass - 1/(alpha' M). Finally, we argue that
two solutions which are related by duality based on a noncompact symmetry are
{\it not} always physically equivalent.

quantum system without affecting the quantum state. A protective measurement
involves adiabatic coupling to the measuring device together with a procedure
to protect the state from changing. For nondegenerate energy eigenstates the
protection is provided by the system itself. In this case it is actually
possible to measure the Schr\""odinger wave via measurements on a single system.
This fact provides an argument in favor of associating physical reality with a
quantum state of a single system, challenging the usual ensemble
interpretation. We also believe that the complete description of a quantum
system requires a two-state vector formalism involving (in addition to the
usual one)a future quantum state evolving backwards in time. Protective
measurements testing the two-state vector reality are constructed.
