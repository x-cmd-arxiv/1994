Potts model, rewriting it in terms of the connectivity, the finite-cluster
connectivity and the infinite-cluster covariance in the random cluster repre-
sentation of Fortuin and Kasteleyn. In any of the $q$ ordered phases, we show
that the matrix $G^{mn}(x-y)$ has one tivial eigenvalue 0, one simple eigen-
value $G_{\wir}^{(1)}(x-y)$ and one ($q-2$)-fold degenerate eigenvalue
$G_{\wir}^{(2)}(x-y)$. Furthermore, we identify the eigenvalues both in terms
of representations of the unbroken symmetry group of the model, and in terms of
connectivities and cluster covariances, thereby attributing algebraic signifi-
cance to these stochastic geometric quantities. In addition to establishing the
existence of the correlation lengths $\xi_{\wir}^{(1)}$ and $\xi_{\wir}^{(2)}$
corresponding to $G_{\wir}^{(1)}(x-y)$ and $G_{\wir}^{(2)}(x-y)$, we show that
$\xi_{\wir}^{(1)}(\beta)\geq \xi_{\wir}^{(2)}(\beta)$ for all inverse tempera-
tures $\beta$. For dimension $d=2$ and $q \geq 1$, we establish a duality
relation between $\xi_{\wir}^{(2)}$ and $\xi_{\free}$, the correlation length
of the two-point function with free boundary conditions: We show
$\xi_{\wir}^{(2)}(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \xi_{\free}(\beta^\ast)$ for all $\beta
\geq \beta_o$, where $\beta^\ast$ is the dual inverse temperature and $\beta_o$
is the self-dual point. In order to prove the above results, we introduce two
new inequalities. The first is similar to the FKG inequality, but holds for
events which are neither increasing nor decreasing, and replaces independence
in the standard percolation model; the second replaces the van den Berg -
Kesten inequality.

those of an unreddened normal main-sequence A star, but it cannot be totally

Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J. 453 (1995) 566","10.1086/187860",,"astro-ph",,"  If the large-scale galaxy distribution is filamentary, as suggested by some
observations and recent hydrodynamical simulations, then lengthwise views of
filaments will apparently produce compact groups (CGs) that are in reality
stretched out along the line of sight. This possibility has been advocated
recently by Hernquist, Katz \& Weinberg (1994). Here, we propose a test for
this hypothesis using X--ray emission from CGs. The observable quantity $Q
\equiv L_{x} a_{p}^{3}/L_{g}^2 T_{x}^{1/2}$ should be proportional to the axis
ratio of the group, $a/c$, where $a$ and $c$ are the long and short axis of a
prolate distribution, $a_p$ is the radius of the group projected onto the sky,
$L_{x}$ is the bolometric X-ray luminosity, $L_{g}$ is the group blue
luminosity, and $T_{x}$ is the gas temperature. We find that the distribution
of $Q$ is consistent with the notion that many spiral-rich CGs with unusually
small values of ($a/c)$ are frauds, i.e. that the values of $Q$ are anomalously
small. An alternative possibility is that CGs are gas-poor relative to rich
clusters; however, this can be tested using the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. If
the groups have a normal ratio of gas-to-total mass, but are simply stretched
out along the line of sight, a Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal should be detectable.

detection of Lyman-alpha absorption lines beyond the quasar redshift. The
effect occurs whenever the distortion to the redshift distribution of
Lyman-alpha clouds induced by the cluster potential extends beyond the
proximity effect of the quasar. Based on CDM cosmological models for the
evolution of structure, we predict the probability for finding lines beyond the
quasar redshift ($z_{abs}>z_Q$) under the assumption that the physical
properties of Lyman-alpha clouds are not affected by flows on large scales (1
Mpc and more) in the quasi-linear regime. If quasars randomly sample the
underlying galaxy distribution, the expected number of lines with $z_{abs}>z_Q$
per quasar can be as high as 0.25[(dN/dz)/350] at $z=2$, where $dN/dz$ is the
number of Lyman-alpha lines per unit redshift far from the quasar. The
probability is enhanced if quasars typically reside in small groups of
galaxies. A statistical excess of Lyman-alpha lines is expected near very dim
quasars or around metal absorption systems. Due to clustering, the standard
approach to the proximity effect overestimates the ionizing background flux at
high redshifts by up to a factor of 3. This result weakens the discrepancy
between the deduced background flux and the contribution from known populations
of quasars.

reduction is optimal at the one-loop level. We then calculate the relevant
scale parameter, $\Lambda_T$, which characterizes the running of

sector. It is found that $\Lambda_T/\Lambda_{\overline{\text{MS}}}

$\tilde{g}^2(T)$ is also optimal for lattice perturbative calculations. Our
result naturally explains why the high temperature limit of QCD sets in at
temperatures as low as a few times the critical temperature. In addition, our
$\Lambda_T$ agrees remarkably well with the scale parameter determined from the
lattice measurement of the spatial string tension of the SU(2) gauge theory at
high $T$.

then derive the set of equations for the expectation values of the vertex

equations is that they can be expanded at small momenta (less than the QCD mass
scale), and solved for expansion coefficients. This provides the relations for
multiple commutators of position operator, which can be used to construct this
operator. We employ the noncommutative probability theory and find the
expansion of the operator $\hat{\cal X}_\mu $ in terms of products of creation
operators $ a_\mu^{\dagger}$. In general, there are some free parameters left
in this expansion. In two dimensions we fix parameters uniquely from the
symplectic invariance. The Fock space of our theory is much smaller than that
of perturbative QCD, where the creation and annihilation operators were
labelled by continuous momenta. In our case this is a space generated by $d =
4$ creation operators. The corresponding states are given by all sentences made

the physical operators in the NS and R sectors. However, the picture-changing
operators are non-invertible in this case, and physical operators in different
pictures cannot be identified. The three-point interactions of all physical
operators leads to three different types of amplitudes, which can be
effectively described by the interactions of a scalar NS operator and a bosonic
spinorial R operator. In the off-diagonal bases for the fermionic currents, the
picture-changing operators are invertible, and hence physical operators in
different pictures can be identified. However, now there is no local operator
$\exp(\lambda \int^z J^{\rm tot})$ that relates the physical operators in

operator and one spinorial R operator. The NS and R operators give rise to
different types of three-point amplitudes, and thus cannot be identified.

one-dimensional translationally invariant Hamiltonian lattices with arbitrary
finite interaction range and arbitrary finite number of degrees of freedom per
unit cell. We analyse a mapping of the Fourier coefficients of the NLE
solution. NLEs correspond to homoclinic points in the phase space of this map.
Using dimensionality properties of separatrix manifolds of the mapping we show
the persistence of NLE solutions under perturbations of the system, provided
NLEs exist for the given system. For a class of nonintegrable Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
chains we rigorously prove the existence of NLE solutions.
