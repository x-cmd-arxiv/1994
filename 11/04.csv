We derive the self-energy renormalization of the the transition amplitude

order to elucidate the role of virtual phonon exchanges in the limiting
behavior of the sticking probability. We demonstrate that, to first order in
the interactions for finite ranged atom-surface potentials, virtual phonons can
only rescale the strength of the atom-surface coupling and do not rescale the
range of the coupling. Thus, universal sticking behaviour at ultra-low energies
is to be expected for all finite ranged potentials. We demonstrate that the
onset of the universal sticking behavior depends greatly on the position of the
shape resonance of the renormalized potential and for sufficiently low energy
shape resonances, deviations from the universal $s(E)\propto\sqrt{E}$ can occur
near these energies. We believe that this accounts for many of the low energy
sticking trends observed in the scattering of sub-millikelvin H atoms from

puzzles may simultaneously be solved by (vacuum as well as matter-induced
resonant) oscillations of two generations of neutrinos with large mixing, we
have analyzed the data on the atmospheric and solar neutrinos assuming that all
{\it three} neutrinos are maximally mixed. It is shown that the values of $
\Delta m^2 $ obtained from the two-generation analyses are still valid even in
the three-generation scheme, i.e. the two puzzles can be solved simultaneously
if $ \Delta m_{31}^2 \simeq 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{eV}^2 $ for the atmospheric
neutrinos and $ \Delta m_{21}^2 \simeq 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{eV}^2 $ for solar
neutrinos in the maximally mixed three-generation scheme.

$CP$-even. The idea is applied to Higgs decay where correlations among momenta
of the decay products may yield the desired information. These are correlations
of decay planes defined by the momenta of pairs of particles as well as
correlations between energy differences. In the case that the Higgs particle is
an eigenstate of $CP$, our study includes finite-width effects. The
correlations between energy differences turn out to be a much better probe for
investigating $CP$ properties than the previously suggested angular
correlations, especially for massive Higgs bosons.

$c_1$ is the first chern number of these vector bundles. In addition, we
managed to proof that under physical natural assumptions the stable vector
bundles correspond to the experimentally dominating series of measured
fractional filling factors $\nu = {n \over 2pn\pm 1}$. Most remarkably, due to
the very special form of the Laughlin wave functions the fluctuations of the
curvature of these vector bundles converge to zero in the limit of infinitely
many particles which shows a new mathematical property. Physically, this means
that in this limit the Hall conductivity is independent of the boundary
conditions which is very important for the observabilty of the effect. Finally
we discuss the relation of this result to a theorem of Donaldson.

ansatz solutions of generalized Gaudin models are constructed. These equations
we call the {\it generalized spectral Riccati equations}, because the simplest
equation of this class has a standard Riccatian form. The general form of these
equations is $R_{n_i}[z_1(\lambda),\ldots, z_r(\lambda)] = c_{n_i}(\lambda), \
i=1,\ldots, r$, where $R_{n_i}$ denote some homogeneous polynomials of degrees
$n_i$ constructed from functional variables $z_i(\lambda)$ and their
derivatives. It is assumed that $\deg \partial^k z_i(\lambda) = k+1$. The
problem is to find all functions $z_i(\lambda)$ and $c_{n_i}(\lambda)$
satisfying the above equations under $2r$ additional constraints $P \
z_i(\lambda)=F_i(\lambda)$ and $(1-P) \ c_{n_i}(\lambda)=0$, where $P$ is a
projector from the space of all rational functions onto the space of rational
functions having their singularities at {\it a priori} given points. It turns
out that this problem has solutions only for very special polynomials $R_{n_i}$
called {\it Riccatians}. There exist a one-to-one correspondence between
systems of Riccatians and simple Lie algebras. Functions $c_{n_i}(\lambda)$
satisfying the system of equations constructed from Riccatians of the type
${\cal L}_r$ exactly coincide with eigenvalues of the Gaudin spectral problem
associated with algebra ${\cal L}_r$. This result suggests that the generalized
Gaudin models admit a total separation of variables.
