Loop-induced FCNC (and CP-violating) effects, when confronted with experimental
constraints for the $K$-$\bar K$, $B$-$\bar B$ and $D$-$\bar D$ mixing and for
the $(b \to s \gamma)$ decay, provide us with constraints on the values of the
dominant Yukawa couplings of the charged Higgs, i.e., the values of the
couplings of $H^{\pm}$ to $t$ and $b$ quarks. Once these {\it low} energy
experimental data relevant for the mixings and for the mentioned decay, as well
as the theoretical uncertainties for the hadronic matrix elements, are
sufficiently reduced, such analyses may be able to rule out the minimal SM and
even certain special types of the 2HDSM's (e.g., the popular ``type II'', and
``type I'' 2HDSM). In such a case, a more general 2HDSM framework discussed
here could still survive as a viable framework. Eventual detection of the
charged Higgs in high energy experiments and the measurement of its mass would
represent important information that would additonally help to rule out or to
favor the various specific 2HDSM scenarios that are contained in the discussed
2HDSM framework.

Furthermore the structure of branching is related to the topology of the
manifold: if there are infinitely many leaves not separated from each other,
then there is an incompressible torus transverse to the flow. Transitivity is
not assumed for these results. Finally, if the manifold has negatively curved

localized case, the wavetrains are completely decoupled at leading order, while
in the periodic case the amplitude equations take the form of mean-field

differential equations. The origin of this weakened coupling is traced to a
hidden translation symmetry in the linear problem, which is related to the
existence of a characteristic frame traveling at the group velocity of each

dynamics of the governing equations on asymptotically long time scales. While
