peculiar velocity analysis: the cluster data of Han, Mould and coworkers
(1991-93, HM) and Willick (1991, W91CL), and the field data of Aaronson et al.
(1992), Willick (1991), Courteau & Faber (1992), and Mathewson et al. (1992),
totaling over 3000 spiral galaxies. We treat the cluster data in this paper,
which is the first of a series; in Paper II we treat the field TF samples.
These data are to be combined with elliptical data (e.g., Faber et al. 1989) to
form the MARK III CATALOG OF GALAXY PECULIAR VELOCITIES, which we will present
in Paper III. The catalog will be used as input for POTENT reconstruction of
velocity and density fields, described in later papers, as well as for
alternative velocity analyses. Our main goal in Papers I & II is to place the
TF data onto a self-consistent system by (i) applying a uniform set of
corrections to the raw observables, (ii) determining the TF slopes and scatters
separately for each sample, and (iii) adjusting the TF zeropoints to ensure
mutually consistent distances. The global zeropoint is set by the HM sample,
chosen because of its depth and uniformity on the sky and its substantial
overlap with each of the other samples. In this paper, we calibrate the
``forward'' and ``inverse'' TF relations for HM and W91CL. We study the
selection criteria for these samples and correct for the resultant statistical
biases. The bias corrections are validated by comparing forward and inverse
cluster distances. We find that many sample clusters are better modeled as
``expanding'' than relaxed, which significantly affects the TF calibrations.
Proper corrections for internal extinction are derived self-consistently from
the data.

  galaxies through gravitational lensing","9 pages, uuencoded compressed postscript including one figure",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We propose a new technique, which we call the lens parallax method, to
determine simultaneously the redshift distribution of the faint blue galaxies
and the mass distribution of foreground clusters of galaxies. The method is
based on gravitational lensing and uses the fact that the mean angular size of
the faint blue galaxies is a well-determined function of surface brightness.
The method requires first a calibration of the angular-size vs. surface
brightness relation in unlensed blank fields and a determination of the mean
redshift of the brightest of the faint blue galaxies. By combining this
information with observations of the distorted images of background galaxies in
the fields of foreground clusters, we show that it is possible to obtain the
mean redshift of the galaxies as a function of their surface brightness. With a
sample of about ten moderate redshift rich clusters and using ten bins in
surface brightness, a bin-to-bin signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim3.5$ can be
achieved. The method simultaneously allows a determination of the convergence
and shear of the lensing cluster as a function of position, and through this
the mass distribution of the lens can be obtained. The lens parallax method can
be used in conjunction with, and will improve the accuracy of, other previously
proposed techniques for mapping clusters.
