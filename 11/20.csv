  Intrinsic Spin Moving in a Constant Magnetic Field",,,,,"acc-phys physics.acc-ph",,"  $O(\hbar)$ effects that modify the classical orbit of a charged particle are
described for the case of a classical spin-1/2 particle moving in a constant
magnetic field, using a manifestly covariant formalism reported previously. It
is found that the coupling between the momentum and spin gives rise to a shift
in the cyclotron frequency, which is explicitly calculated. In addition the
orbit is found to exhibit $O(\hbar)$ oscillations along the axis of the uniform
static magnetic field whenever the gyromagnetic ratio $g$ of the particle is
not 2. This oscillation is found to occur at a frequency $\propto$ $\frac{g}{2}
- 1$, and is an observable source of electric dipole radiation.

  Compare to previous version, essential changes are made in Sec. VII",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.51.3856",,"cond-mat",,"  A theory of the t-J model in the presence of an external electromagnetic
field is presented. The 1/N expansion for this model in the slave-fermion
representation is developed, and it is shown that all the general properties of
the theory are satisfied in every order of the 1/N expansion separately. A
convenient procedure of the gauge fixing is suggested. It is shown that
superconductivity may exist in this model even in the absence of the electron
pairing. It is argued that experimental predictions of the theory might agree
with the observed properties of the copper oxides.

lattices and demonstrate that these models exhibit continuous phase
transitions, contrary to the first order transition present on regular
lattices. For $q=10$ the transition seems to be of 2nd order, while it seems to
be of 3rd order for $q=200$. For $q=200$ the phase transition also induces a
transition between typical fractal structures of the piecewise linear surfaces
corresponding to the triangulations. The typical surface changes from having a
tree-like structure to a fractal structure characterizing pure gravity when the
temperature drops below the critical temperature. An investigation of the
alignment of spin clusters shows that they are strongly correlated to the
underlying fractal structure of the triangulated surfaces.

$O(N)$ non-linear sigma model at the critical point, in the large $N$ limit, on
various three dimensional manifolds of constant curvature. The two--point
correlation function, $G(x, y)$, is the only $n$-point correlation function
which survives in this limit. We analyze the short distance and long distance
behaviour of $G(x, y)$. It is shown that $G(x, y)$ decays exponentially with
the Riemannian distance on the spaces $R^2 \times S^1,~S^1 \times S^1 \times R,
~S^2 \times R,~H^2 \times R$. The decay on $R^3$ is of course a power law. We
show that the scale for the correlation length is given by the geometry of the
space and therefore the long distance behaviour of the critical correlation
function is not necessarily a power law even though the manifold is of infinite
extent in all directions; this is the case of the hyperbolic space where the
radius of curvature plays the role of a scale parameter. We also verify that
the scalar field in this theory is a primary field with weight $\delta=-{1
\over 2}$; we illustrate this using the example of the manifold $S^2 \times R$
whose metric is conformally equivalent to that of $R^3-\{0\}$ up to a
reparametrization.
