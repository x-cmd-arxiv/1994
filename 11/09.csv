isentropic (admits a barotropic equation of state), (c) the source of a
spacetime for which $r\ge 2$, where $r$ is the dimension of the orbit of the
isometry group. This consistency scheme is tested also in two large classes of
known exact solutions for which $r< 2$, in general: perfect fluid Szekeres
solutions (classes I and II). In none of these cases, the Gibbs-Duhem relation
is integrable, in general, though specific particular cases of Szekeres class
II (all complying with $r<2$) are identified for which the integrability of
this relation can be achieved. We show that Szekeres class I solutions satisfy
the integrability conditions only in two trivial cases, namely the spherically
symmetric limiting case and the Friedman-Roberson-Walker (FRW) cosmology.

invoking R-parity. A necessary ingredient to enforce R-parity is the
possibility of distinguishing the lepton superfields from the Higgs ones. This
is generally achieved either by assuming different charges under some matter
parity, or by assigning the superfields to different representations of a
unified gauge group. We want to put forward the idea that the replica of the
fermion generations, which constitute an intrinsic difference between the
fermions and the Higgs superfields, can give a clue to understand R-parity as
an accidental symmetry. More ambitiously, we suggest a possible relation
between proton stability and the actual number of fermion generations. We carry
out our investigation in the framework of non-Abelian horizontal gauge
symmetries. We identify $SU(4)_H$ as the only acceptable horizontal gauge group
whichcan naturally ensure the absence of R parity violating operators, without
conflicting with other theoretical and phenomenological constraints. We analyze
a version of the supersymmetric standard model equipped with a gauged
horizontal $SU(4)_H$, in which R-parity is accidental. The model predicts four
families of fermions, it allows for the dynamical generation of a realistic
hierarchy of fermion masseswithout any ad hoc choice of small Yukawa couplings,
it ensures in a natural way the heaviness of all the fourth family fermions
(including the neutrino) and it predicts a {\it lower} limit for the
$\tau$-neutrino mass of a few eV. The scale of the breaking of the horizontal
symmetry can be constrained rather precisely in a narrow window around $\sim
10^{11}$ GeV. Some interesting astrophysical and cosmological implications of
the model are addressed as well.

discuss the general properties of the relevant instanton solutions which
dominate the transition amplitudes at finite energy, and find the solutions
numerically. The Euclidean period of the solution increases with energy,
contrary to the behavior found in the abelian Higgs model or simple one
dimensional systems. This indicates that there is a sharp crossover from
instanton dominated tunneling to sphaleron dominated thermal activation at a
certain critical temperature in this model. We argue that the electroweak
theory in four dimensions should exhibit a similar behavior.

to the simple form of that cocycle, quadratic over Weyl field $\sigma$, i.e.
the form, similar to the two-dimensional Lioville action. This form also
establishes the connection of the cocycles with conformal-invariant operators

understand how the d-wave behaviour of the system is modified by the coupling
between the layer-types. This coupling takes the form of coherent, single
particle tunneling along the c-axis. We find that there are two physically
different limits of behaviour, which depend on the relative locations of the
Fermi surfaces of the two layer-types. We also discuss the interference between
the interlayer coupling and pairing interaction and we find that this
