(BCGs) are recovered from the observed color profiles by evaluating spurious
gradients introduced by errors in the determination of the sky levels and by
different seeing conditions between the observations. Isophote shapes and
surface brightness profiles are presented for the four newly observed BCGs.
Three out of nine BCGs show color gradients of the order of 0.10 mag per decade
in radius. Five BCGs do not possess any color gradient larger than 0.01 mag per
decade in radius. We do not see any correlation between the presence (or the
sign) of a color gradient and the BCG morphology (slope and shape of its
surface brightness profile), or the cluster richness. This argues against a
strong and recent influence of the environment on the BCG morphology. The slope
of the BCG surface brightness profile is correlated to the cluster richness,
posing a constraint on the initial conditions, or on the physical mechanism
that is responsible for the present BCG morphology. Finally, only one BCG can
be a cD despite visual classification as such of all studied BCGs.

  a Letter in Astronomy and Astrophysics","Astron.Astrophys.293:L37,1995",,"MPK-ASTRO-94-04","astro-ph",,"  When applied to the blast wave formed by the explosion of a massive star as a
supernova (SN), the theory of diffusive particle acceleration at shock fronts
predicts a very high energy density in cosmic rays. Almost immediately after
particles begin to be injected into the process, the cosmic ray pressure rises
until comparable to the ram-pressure encountered by the shock front. Those
supernovae which are observed in the radio band i.e., radio supernovae (RSNe),
provide direct evidence of particle acceleration in the form of synchrotron
emitting electrons. Furthermore, these objects are particularly interesting,
since they are usually surrounded by a relatively dense confining medium. The
acceleration of cosmic rays can then lead to the production of very high energy
(VHE) gamma-rays which arise from collisions between energetic particles and
target nuclei. We estimate the cosmic ray energy density assuming a fraction
$\phi\lesim1$ of the energy available at the shock front is converted into
cosmic rays. Combining this with the parameters describing the environment of
the SN progenitor, as deduced from observations, and from more detailed
modelling, we compute the flux at Earth $\tevflux$ of photons of energy above
$1\,$TeV. For the relatively weak but nearby supernova SN1987A we predict
$\tevflux=2\times10^{-13}\,\fluxunits$ before the shock front encounters the
ring of dense matter seen by the Hubble Space Telescope. Subsequently, the flux
is expected to rise further. The medium around SN1993J in M81 is thought to
have a density

the type of unit classifier because other types are open due to the meaning of

the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase.

continuation, and Galois groups of certain polynomials.
  Internal addresses are a convenient and efficient way of describing the
combinatorial structure of the Mandelbrot set, and of giving geometric meaning
to the ubiquitous kneading sequences in human-readable form (Sections 3 and 4).
A simple extension, \emph{angled internal addresses}, distinguishes
combinatorial classes of the Mandelbrot set and in particular distinguishes
hyperbolic components in a concise and dynamically meaningful way.
  This combinatorial description of the Mandelbrot set makes it possible to
derive existence theorems for certain kneading sequences and internal addresses
in the Mandelbrot set (Section~6) and to give an explicit description of the
associated parameters. These in turn help to establish some algebraic results
about permutations of periodic points and to determine Galois groups of certain
polynomials (Section~7).
  Through internal addresses, various areas of mathematics are thus related in
this manuscript, including symbolic dynamics and permutations, combinatorics of
the Mandelbrot set, and Galois groups.
