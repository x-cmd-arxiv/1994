$\alpha_s(\mz)$ and $\bar{\alpha}(\mmz)$, are examined in detail. Even though
the mean value of $S$ is increased to be consistent with zero, the naive
Technicolor models are still disfavored due to its reduced error. Within the
SM, we find the 90\,\%CL constraints; $133\gev<m_t<190\gev$ and
$10\gev<\mh<440\gev$ for $\alpha_s(\mz)=0.116$ and $1/\bar{\alpha}(\mmz)

precisely known, the present electroweak data give a rather strict upper bound
