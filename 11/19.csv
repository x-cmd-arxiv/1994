recent theories, is presented. Fragmentation, occurring at the end of the
secondary collapse phase (during which molecular hydrogen is dissociating), can
form binary systems with separations less than 1 au. Two fragmentation modes
are found to occur after the collapse is halted. The first consists of the
fragmentation of a protostellar disc due to rotational instabilities in a
protostellar core, involving both an $m=1$ and an $m=2$ mode. This
fragmentation mechanism is found to be insensitive to the initial density
distribution: it can occur in both centrally condensed and uniform initial
conditions. The second fragmentation mode involves the formation of a rapidly
rotating core at the end of the collapse phase which is unstable to the
axisymmetric perturbations. This core bounces into a ring which quickly
fragments into several components. The binary systems thus formed contain less
than 1 per cent of a solar mass and therefore will need to accrete most of
their final mass if they are to form a binary star system. Their orbital
properties will thus be determined by the properties of the accreted matter.

($2\sigma$) to fit the observed number of large separation lenses, and the
constraint is nearly independent of $H_0=100h^{-1}\kms$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This range
is strongly inconsistent with the COBE estimate of $\sigma_8=(2.8\pm0.2)h$.
Tilting the primordial spectrum $\propto k^n$ from $n=1$ to $0.3 \ltorder n
\ltorder 0.7$, using an effective Hubble constant of $0.15 \ltorder \Gamma=h
\ltorder 0.30$, or reducing the matter density to $0.15 \ltorder \Omega_0 h
\ltorder 0.3$ either with no cosmological constant ($\lambda_0=0$) or in a flat
universe with a cosmological constant ($\Omega_0+\lambda_0=1$) can bring the
lensing estimate of $\sigma_8$ into agreement with the COBE estimates. The
models and values for $\sigma_8$ consistent with both lensing and COBE match
the estimates from the local number density of clusters and correlation
functions. The conclusions are insensitive to systematic errors except for the
assumption that cluster core radii are singular. If clusters with
$\rho\propto(r^2+s^2)^{-1}$ have core radii exceeding $s = 15h^{-1}\sigma_3^2$
kpc for a cluster with velocity dispersion $\sigma=10^3\sigma_3 \kms$ then the
estimates are invalid. There is, however, a fine tuning problem in making the
cluster core radii large enough to invalidate the estimates of $\sigma_8$ while
producing several lenses that do not have central or ``odd images.'' The
estimated completeness of the current samples of lenses larger than $5\parcs0$
is 20\%, because neither quasar surveys nor lens surveys are optimized to this
class of lenses.

debate. In a nonrotating but aspherical gravitational collapse to form a
spherical charged black hole, the backscattered gravitational wave tails enter
the black hole and are blueshifted at the Cauchy horizon. This has a
catastrophic effect if combined with an outflux crossing the Cauchy horizon: a
singularity develops at the Cauchy horizon and the effective mass inflates.
Recently a numerical study of a massless scalar field in the \RN background
suggested that a spacelike singularity may form before the Cauchy horizon
forms. We will show that there exists an approximate analytic solution of the
scalar field equations which allows the mass inflation singularity at the
Cauchy horizon to exist. In particular, we see no evidence that the Cauchy
horizon is preceded by a spacelike singularity.

introducing a new distribution amplitude that evolves more smoothly, this
logarithmic modification can be included in the hard-scattering part of the

particle interactions. If they exist, they may help to explain some of the
largest-scale structures seen in the Universe today. They are `topological
defects' that may have been formed at phase transitions in the very early
history of the Universe, analogous to those found in some condensed-matter
systems --- vortex lines in liquid helium, flux tubes in type-II
superconductors, or disclination lines in liquid crystals. In this review, we
describe what they are, why they have been hypothesized and what their
cosmological implications would be. The relevant background from the standard
models of particle physics and cosmology is described in section 1. In section
2, we review the idea of symmetry breaking in field theories, and show how the
defects formed are constrained by the topology of the manifold of degenerate
vacuum states. We also discuss the different types of cosmic strings that can
appear in different field theories. Section 3 is devoted to the dynamics of
cosmic strings, and section 4 to their interaction with other fields. The
formation and evolution of cosmic strings in the early Universe is the subject
of section 5, while section 6 deals with their observational implications.
Finally, the present status of the theory is reviewed in section 7.
