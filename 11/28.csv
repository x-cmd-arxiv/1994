(SOC), based on the recognition that it is nothing but the expression,
''unfolded'' in a suitable parameter space, of an underlying {\em unstable}
dynamical critical point. More precisely, SOC is shown to result from the
tuning of the {\em order parameter} to a vanishingly small, but {\em positive}
value, thus ensuring that the corresponding control parameter lies exactly at
its critical value for the underlying transition. This clarifies the role and
nature of the {\em very slow driving rate} common to all systems exhibiting
SOC. This mechanism is shown to apply to models of sandpiles, earthquakes,
depinning, fractal growth and forest-fires, which have been proposed as
examples of SOC.

loud quasars below a critical disk luminosity of ~10^46 erg/sec in the PG
sample. We argue that the opening angle of the obscuring torus in radio loud
quasars depends on the power of the central engine, approaching the jet's
beaming angle near the FR I/FR II break. Consequently, low power radio quasars
would either be classified as radio galaxies (FR I) or strongly core-boosted
(BL Lac) object, depending on the aspect angle, and no conspicuous transitional
population would be expected for FR I sources. A closing torus with decreasing
power would not only obscure the optical nucleus for most aspect angles but
would also enhance the entrainment of the cool torus material into the jet
stream, causing obscuration along the jet's periphery, as well as the jet's
deceleration to form a FR I source. Above a critical luminosity, the wider
torus allows for FR II type jets and visibility of the nuclear optical
emission, characteristic of radio loud quasars. Apparently, at the same engine
power the torus opening in radio weak quasars and Seyferts is substantially
wider than in radio loud quasars, probably because of different dynamics or
feeding mechanisms in disk and elliptical galaxies. This provides a clue for
the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy of quasars if the the jet/torus
interaction leads to injection of relativistic e^+/- pairs via p-p collisions.
Strong jet/torus interaction may lead to a substantial injection of secondary
pairs and collimation in radio loud quasars, while weak interaction in radio
weak quasars leads neither to pair injection nor to good collimation.

equation. By virtue of such a gauge symmetry we can greatly simplify the
analysis of the SD equation by taking the most appropriate gauge (``nonlocal
gauge'') for the HLS.
  In the case of even-number of (2-component) fermions, we find the dynamical
fermion mass generation as the second order phase transition at certain fermion
number, which breaks the chiral symmetry but preserves the parity in (2+1)
dimensions ($D=3$). In the infinite four-fermion coupling (massless gauge
boson) limit in (2+1) dimensions, the result coincides with that of the

(2-component) fermion in (2+1) dimensions, the regularization ambiguity on the
induced Chern-Simons term may be resolved by specifying the regularization so
as to preserve the HLS.
  Our method also applies to the (1+1) dimensions, the result being consistent

"math/9411228",,"M. Lawrence Glasser, Victor Kowalenko","Extensions and results from a method for evaluating fractional integrals",,,,"OP-SF 28 Nov 1994","math.CA",,"  We present a method derived from Laplace transform theory that enables the
evaluation of fractional integrals. This method is adapted and extended in a
variety of ways to demonstrate its utility in deriving alternative
representations for other classes of integrals. We also use the method in
conjunction with several different techniques to derive many results that have
not appeared in tables of integrals.
