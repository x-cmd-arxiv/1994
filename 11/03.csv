galaxies are the youngest and dominated by the products of early enrichment by
massive stars, while more metal-rich galaxies show increasing, delayed
contributions of C from intermediate mass stars. However, recent evolution
models for massive stars including mass loss suggest that the yield of C
relative to O may increase with metallicity; new chemical evolution models for
the solar neighborhood which account for this predict a C/O abundance evolution
similar to that observed in the metal-poor galaxies. The C/N ratio increases
steadily with O/H in the irregular galaxies, but is much smaller in solar
neighborhood stars and H II regions. This may indicate that the bulk of N
production is decoupled from that of C in the Galaxy.

the initial population. Among the evolutionary influences on the population is
the destruction of globular clusters by tidal forces as the cluster moves
through the field of influence of a disk, a bulge, and/or a putative nuclear
component (black hole). We have conducted a series of N-body simulations of
globular clusters on bound and marginally bound orbits through potentials that
include black hole and spheroidal components. The degree of concentration of
the spheroidal component can have a considerable impact on the extent to which
a globular cluster is disrupted. If half the mass of a $10^{10} \msun$ spheroid
is concentrated within 800pc, then only black holes with masses $>10^9 \msun$
can have a significant tidal influence over that already exerted by the bulge.
However, if the matter in the spheroidal component is not so strongly
concentrated toward the center of the galaxy, a more modest central black hole
(down to $10^8 \msun$) could have a dominant influence on the globular cluster
distribution, particularly if many of the clusters were initially on highly
radial orbits. Our simulations show that the stars that are stripped from a
globular cluster follow orbits with roughly the same eccentricity as the
initial cluster orbit, spreading out along the orbit like a ``string of
pearls''. Since only clusters on close to radial orbits will suffer substantial
disruption, the population of stripped stars will be on orbits of high
eccentricity.

chemical potential. To locate the critical point of the model, the cumulant
intersection method is used. The accuracy of this approach for determining the
critical parameters of fluids is assessed. Attention is then focused on the
joint distribution function of the critical concentration and energy, which is
analysed using a mixed-field finite-size-scaling theory that takes due account
of the lack of symmetry between the coexisting phases. The essential Ising
character of the binary polymer critical point is confirmed by mapping the
critical scaling operator distributions onto independently known forms
appropriate to the 3D Ising universality class. In the process, estimates are

large viscosity. Finally, at higher temperatures in the disordered phase, the

to ambiguities in high energy cross sections that are suppressed by powers of
large momentum scales. These ambiguities are caused by infrared renormalons,
which are a general feature of resummed hard-scattering functions in
perturbative QCD, even though these functions are infrared safe order-by-order
in perturbation theory. As in the case of the operator product expansion, the
contributions of infrared renormalons to coefficient functions may be absorbed
into the definition of higher-dimensional operators, which induce
nonperturbative corrections that are power-suppressed at high energies. The
strength of the suppression is determined by the location of the dominant
infrared renormalon, which may be identified explicitly in the resummed series.
In contrast to the operator product expansion, however, the relevant operators
in factorized hadron-hadron scattering and jet cross sections are generally
nonlocal in QCD, although they may be expressed as local operators in an
effective theory for eikonalized quarks. In this context, we verify and
interpret the presence of $1/Q$ corrections to the inclusive Drell-Yan cross
section with $Q$ the pair mass. In a similar manner, we find $\exp(-b^2\ln Q)$
corrections in the impact parameter space of the transverse momentum
distributions of the Drell-Yan process and $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We also show
that the dominant nonperturbative corrections to cone-based jet cross sections
behave as $1/(Q\delta)$, with $\delta$ the opening angle of the jet and $Q$ the
center of mass energy.

generally expects similar $\pi^+ B^0$ and $\pi^- B^+$ correlations (non-exotic
channels), and similar $\pi^- B^0$ and $\pi^+ B^+$ correlations (exotic
channels). Exceptions include (a) fragmentation processes involving exchange of
quarks with the producing system, (b) misidentification of charged kaons as
charged pions, and (c) effects of decay products of the associated
$\overline{B}$. All of these can affect the apparent signal for correlations of
charged $B$ mesons with charged hadrons. The identification of the flavor of
neutral $B$ mesons through the decay $B^0 \to K^{*0} J/\psi$ requires good
particle identification in order that the decay $K^{*0} \to K^+ \pi^-$ not be
mistaken for $\overline{K}^{*0} \to K^- \pi^+$, in which case the correlations
of neutral $B$ mesons with hadrons can be underestimated.

Determination of errors would involve consideration of the experimental

theoretical calculation is relatively clean. Two different methods are employed
for the study of $\b$. In the first method, both $b$ and $s$ quarks are treated
as heavy and leading $1/m_s$ as well as $1/m_b$ corrections are included. The
branching ratio and the asymmetry parameter $\alpha$ are found to be
$(0.7-1.5)\times 10^{-3}$ and $0.18$, respectively. In the second method, only
the $b$ quark is treated as heavy. The prediction of the decay rate is very
sensitive to the choice of the $q^2$ dependence for form factors. We obtain
$\alpha=0.31$ and ${\cal B}(\b) \simeq 1.6\times 10^{-4}$ for dipole $q^2$

important we extend these techniques to deal with the general matrix model, in
which the matrices do not have independent distributions and are coupled. We
can thus construct the master field for any matrix model, in a well defined

operators---one for each matrix variable---satisfying the Cuntz algebra. We
also discuss the equations of motion obeyed by the master field.

unknown subset $P$ of $\cO$. The task is to determine $P$ by using queries of
the type ``does $P$ intersect $Q$'', where $Q$ is a subset of $\cO$. This
problem occurs in areas such as fault detection, multiaccess communications,
optimal search, blood testing and chromosome mapping. Consider the two stage
algorithm for solving a group testing problem. In the first stage a
predetermined set of queries are asked in parallel and in the second stage, $P$
is determined by testing individual objects. Let $n=\cardof{\cO}$. Suppose that
$P$ is generated by independently adding each $x\in \cO$ to $P$ with
probability $p/n$. Let $q_1$ ($q_2$) be the number of queries asked in the
first (second) stage of this algorithm. We show that if
$q_1=o(\log(n)\log(n)/\log\log(n))$, then $\Exp(q_2) = n^{1-o(1)}$, while there
exist algorithms with $q_1 = O(\log(n)\log(n)/\log\log(n))$ and $\Exp(q_2) =
o(1)$. The proof involves a relaxation technique which can be used with
arbitrary distributions. The best previously known bound is $q_1+\Exp(q_2) =
\Omega(p\log(n))$. For general group testing algorithms, our results imply that
if the average number of queries over the course of $n^\gamma$ ($\gamma>0$)
independent experiments is $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$, then with high probability
$\Omega(\log(n)\log(n)/\log\log(n))$ non-singleton subsets are queried. This
settles a conjecture of Bill Bruno and David Torney and has important
consequences for the use of group testing in screening DNA libraries and other
applications where it is more cost effective to use non-adaptive algorithms
and/or too expensive to prepare a subset $Q$ for its first test.
