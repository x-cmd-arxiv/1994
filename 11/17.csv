indistinguishable from each other, as are the thick disk and the old disk. Each

are widely used {\em e.g.} in computer simulations in physics applications. The
first two tests, the cluster test and the autocorrelation test, are based on
analogies to the two-dimensional Ising model. The next two, the random walk
test and the $n$-block test, are based on studies of random walks, and the
condition number test presented last uses some results of Gaussian distributed
random matrices. Studies with several commonly used pseudorandom number
generators reveal that the cluster test is particularly powerful in finding
periodic correlations on bit level, and that the autocorrelation test, the
random walk test, and the $n$-block test are very effective in detecting
short-ranged correlations. The results of the condition number test are mostly
inconclusive, however. By means of the tests presented in this work, two
important results are found. First, we show quantitatively that the reason for
erroneous results in some recent high precision Monte Carlo simulations for
some commonly used pseudorandom number generators are the so called triple
correlations in the sequences. Then, we show that the properties of such a
sequence may be considerably improved, if only a certain portion of it is used.

transition to a phase with commensurate, antiferromagnetic long-range order.
Depending upon the Fermi surface topology, mean-field spin-density-wave theory
predicts two different types of such transitions, with mean-field dynamic
critical exponents $z=1$ (when the Fermi surface does not cross the magnetic
zone boundary, type $A$) and $z=2$ (when the Fermi surface crosses the magnetic
zone boundary, type $B$). The type $A$ system only displays $z=1$ behavior at
all energies and its scaling properties are similar (though not identical) to
those of an insulating Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Under suitable conditions
precisely stated in this paper, the type $B$ system displays a crossover from
relaxational behavior at low energies to type $A$ behavior at high energies. A
scaling hypothesis is proposed to describe this crossover: we postulate a
universal scaling function which determines the entire, temperature-,
wavevector-, and frequency-dependent, dynamic, staggered spin susceptibility in
terms of 4 measurable, $T=0$, parameters (determining the distance, energy, and
order parameter scales, plus one crossover parameter). The scaling function
contains the full scaling behavior in all regimes for both type $A$ and $B$
systems. The crossover behavior of the uniform susceptibility and the specific
heat is somewhat more complicated and is also discussed. Explicit computation
of the crossover functions is carried out in a large $N$ expansion on a
mean-field model. Some new results for the critical properties on the ordered
side of the transition are also obtained in a spin-density wave formalism. The

rapidly a small-sized hadronic wave packet expands. Here we use SU(2) lattice
gauge theory with Wilson fermions in the quenched approximation to investigate
the expansion. The wave packet is modeled by a point hadronic source, often
used as an interpolating field in lattice calculations. The procedure is to
determine the Euclidean time (t), pion channel, Bethe-Salpeter amplitude
$\Psi(r,t)$, and then evaluate $b^2(t)=\int d^3 r \Psi(r,t) r^2 sin^2 \theta
\Psi_{\pi}(r)$. This quantity represents the soft interaction of a small-sized
wave packet with a pion. The time dependence of $b^2(t)$ is fit as a
superposition of three states, which is found sufficient to reproduce a reduced
size wave packet. Using this superposition allows us to make the analytic
continuation required to study the wave packet expansion in real time. We find
that the matrix elements of the soft interaction $\hat b^2$ between the excited
and ground state decrease rapidly with the energy of the excited state.

"math/9411210",,"Beata Randrianantoanina","Isometries of Hilbert space valued function spaces",,,,"Banach Archive 11/16/94","math.FA",,"  Let $X$ be a (real or complex) rearrangement-in\-va\-riant function space on
$\Om$ (where $\Om = [0,1]$ or $\Om \subseteq \bbN$) whose norm is not
proportional to the $L_2$-norm. Let $H$ be a separable Hilbert space. We
characterize surjective isometries of $X(H).$ We prove that if $T$ is such an
isometry then there exist Borel maps $a:\Om\to\bbK$ and $\sigma:\Om\lra\Om$ and
a strongly measurable operator map $S$ of $\Om$ into $\calB(H)$ so that for
almost all $\om$ $S(\om)$ is a surjective isometry of $H$
  and for any $f\in X(H)$ $$Tf(\om)=a(\om)S(\om)(f(\sigma(\om))) \text{ a.e.}$$
  As a consequence we obtain a new proof of characterization of surjective
isometries in complex rearrangement-invariant function spaces.

polymerized C60 chains, with magnetic properties that suggest a non-metallic
ground state. We study the paramagnetic state of this phase using
first-principles electronic-structure methods, and examine the magnetic
fluctuations around this state using a model Hamiltonian. The electronic and
magnetic properties of even this polymerized phase remain strongly three
dimensional, and the magnetic fluctuations favor an unusual three-dimensional
antiferromagnetically ordered structure with a semi-metallic electronic
spectrum.

ferroelectricity in cubic perovskite compounds. Our first-principles
calculations show that coexistence of both instabilities is very common. We
develop a first-principles scheme to study the thermodynamics of these
compounds when both instabilities are present, and apply it to SrTiO$_3$. We
find that increased pressure enhances the antiferrodistortive instability while
suppressing the ferroelectric one. Moreover, the presence of one instability
tends to suppress the other. A very rich $P$--$T$ phase diagram results.
