galaxy population. A combination of earlier redshift surveys with two new
surveys allows the first accurate determination of the evolution of the
luminosity function with redshift, and reveals a marked steepening of the faint
end slope. This effect is more profound for star-forming galaxies - there are
5-10 times as many star-forming galaxies at z~0.5 as there are locally. These
results, together with high-resolution imaging and linewidth velocity
measurements, support the view that the excess of star-forming galaxies at
moderate redshift represents a general increase in the star-formation rate of
normal galaxies rather than a distinct new population. This increase in
star-formation appears in lower-L galaxies at lower redshift and only appears
in L* galaxies at z>0.5. Imaging studies provide indirect evidence which
suggests that interactions are responsible for a large part of this increased
activity.

statistical mechanical system defined in the same spatial dimension. In some

the latter process leads to a different form of the renormalized tunneling
frequency of the TC, and the tunneling motion is damped with a temperature
dependent relaxation rate. As the temperature is lowered, the relaxation rate
per temperature shows a steep rise as opposed to that in the absence of
electron assisted process. It is expected that this behavior should be observed
at very low temperatures in a careful experiment. The present work thus tries
to go beyond the existing work on the {\it dynamics} of a two-level system in

constitute a Fock space. We demonstrate that, in these representations, the
nonlocal interactions between charges and between charges and transverse
currents, as well as the interactions between currents and massive propagating
photons, are identical in the different gauges we analyze in this and in
earlier work. We construct the generators of the Poincar\'e group, show that
they implement the Poincar\'e algebra, and explicitly demonstrate the effect of
rotations and Lorentz boosts on the particle states. We show that the
imposition of Gauss's law does not produce any ``exotic'' fractional
statistics. In the case of the covariant gauges, this demonstration makes use
of unitary transformations that provide charged particles with the gauge fields
required by Gauss's law, but that leave the anticommutator algebra of the
spinor fields untransformed. In the Coulomb gauge, we show that the
anticommutators of the spinor fields apply to the Dirac-Bergmann constraint
surfaces, on which Gauss's law and the gauge conditions obtain. We examine MCS

nonzero, constants, which is derivable using the so-called Boussinesq
approximation. Two special cases of this equation, or the equivalent nonlocal
equation obtained by setting $u_x=U$, have been discussed in the literature.
The case $\alpha=2\beta$ was discussed by Ablowitz, Kaup, Newell and Segur
[{\it Stud.\ Appl.\ Math.}, {\bf53} (1974) 249], who showed that this case was
solvable by inverse scattering through a second order linear problem. This case
and the case $\alpha=\beta$ were studied by Hirota and Satsuma [{\it J.\ Phys.\
Soc.\ Japan}, {\bf40} (1976) 611] using Hirota's bi-linear technique. Further
the case $\alpha=\beta$ is solvable by inverse scattering through a third order
linear problem. In this paper a catalogue of symmetry reductions is obtained
using the classical Lie method and the nonclassical method due to Bluman and
Cole [{\it J.\ Math.\ Mech.\/}, {\bf 18} (1969) 1025]. The classical Lie method
yields symmetry reductions of (1) expressible in terms of the first, third and
fifth \p\ transcendents and Weierstrass elliptic functions. The nonclassical
method yields a plethora of exact solutions of (1) with $\alpha=\beta$ which
possess a rich variety of qualitative behaviours. These solutions all like a
two-soliton solution for $t<0$ but differ radically for $t>0$ and may be viewed
as a nonlinear superposition of two solitons, one travelling to the left with
arbitrary speed and the other to the right with equal and opposite speed.
