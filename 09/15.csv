events, it is possible to distinguish disk from bulge Machos and to determine
individual masses of disk Machos to an accuracy of $0.2$ in the log. This is at
least a 3-fold improvement over what can be done without parallaxes, i.e., just
from the observed time scale of the events. In addition, we show that the
physical distribution of disk Machos can be found from `reduced' velocities
determined by parallax measurements.

We solve this equation by deriving its Green function; the Green functions for
the peculiar velocity and the real-space density follow directly.
Reconstruction of the cosmic fields is thus reduced to integration over
redshift space with the appropriate Green function kernel. Our algorithm has a

Second-order phase transitions appear on the Maclaurin sequence also at the

Distinguishing characteristic of each second-order phase transition is the
(non)conservation of an integral of motion (e.g. circulation) which determines
the appearance of the transition. Circulation is not conserved in stellar
systems because the stress-tensor gradient terms that appear in the Jeans
equations of motion include viscosity-like off-diagonal terms of the same order
of magnitude as the conventional pressure gradient terms. This explains why the
Jacobi bifurcation is a point of dynamical instability in stellar systems but
only a point of secular instability in viscous fluids. The second-order phase

the shape of a domain containing an XY-like order parameter. In such a domain
the energy per unit length of a segment of the bounding curve depends not only
on the orientation of the segment, but also on the segment's position, and this
is why the Wulff construction must be generalized. When the domain is circular
in shape we find that the problem of finding the texture that minimizes the
bulk and boundary energies is exactly solvable in certain important cases.
Using the generalized Wulff construction and the exact textures, describable in
terms of virtual singularities, we find that, given reasonable assumptions
concerning the from of the boundary energy, the domain will necessarily develop
a cusp if it is sufficiently large. This result is in qualitative agreement
with recent experimental observations.

action recovers QCD with its scale and chiral symmetry properties at short

of symmetry breaking gluon and quark condensates. The approach is applied to
the evolution of a fragmenting $q\bar q$ pair with its generated gluon

decrease noticeably the lower bound on the leptoquark mass $M_X$ originated

D50 (1994) 7430-7439","10.1103/PhysRevD.50.7430",,"hep-th hep-ph",,"  String theories should reduce to ordinary four-dimensional field theories at
low energies. Yet the formulation of the two are so different that such a
connection, if it exists, is not immediately obvious. With the Schwinger
proper-time representation, and the spinor helicity technique, it has been
shown that field theories can indeed be written in a string-like manner, thus
resulting in simplifications in practical calculations, and providing novel
insights into gauge and gravitational theories. This paper continues the study
of string organization of field theories by focusing on the question of local
duality. It is shown that a single expression for the sum of many diagrams can
indeed be written for QED, thereby simulating the duality property in strings.
The relation between a single diagram and the dual sum is somewhat analogous to
the relation between a old- fashioned perturbation diagram and a Feynman
diagram. Dual expressions are particularly significant for gauge theories
because they are gauge invariant while expressions for single diagrams are not.
