proper motions, radial velocity and metallicity. We construct the velocity
ellipsoids for the metal rich stars and metal poor stars. We find a vertex
deviation characteristic of a non-axisymmetric system. The long axes of the
velocity ellipsoids of two samples point to two nearly perpendicular directions
(lv,bv)=(-65+-9,+14+-9) and (25+-14,-11+-14) respectively. The vertex
deviations of the velocity ellipsoids cannot be consistently explained by ANY
oblate model. We populate orbits in a realistic bar potential with a Gaussian
velocity distribution, allowing us to simulate and interpret observations. We
conclude that the data are consistent with a triaxial bulge pointing towards
(l,b) with l<0 and b=0 as suggested by earlier work. We also predict that low
latitude abs(b)<4 deg bulge fields should show the vertex deviation more
strongly and would therefore be the best locations for future proper motion
studies. The metal rich and metal poor stars appear to occupy the direct boxy
and retrograde loop orbits. The correlations between the metallicity and the
orbit families can develop if the Bulge forms dissipatively on a sufficiently
long time scale. However, it is difficult to reconcile the existence of such
correlations with a violent history for the potential of the inner Galaxy.

Observatory Synthesis Telescope sensitive, wide-field radio images at 1.4 GHz

of post-burst timescales between 3 and 15 days, as well as 26, 47 and 99 days.
We place an upper limit of 3.5 mJy on a fading/flaring radio counterpart at 1.4

a counterpart at only one epoch following the outburst. In contrast, the
present search maintains high sensitivity over two decades of post-burst time
durations. Time-variable radio emission after the initial gamma-ray burst is a
prediction of all fireball models, currently the most popular model for
gamma-ray bursts. Our observations allow us to put significant constraints on
the fireball parameters for cosmological models of gamma-ray bursts.

its physical origin. By using controlled low energy projection, an effective
Hamiltonian is mapped out for the finite region in the phase diagram around the

proved from general symmetry considerations. The effective Hamiltonian is
solved exactly not only at the critical point but also for the surrounding

metallic tunnel junctions with high charging energies. If the resistance of the
barriers is large compared to the quantum resistance, transport can be
described by sequential tunneling. Here we study the influence of quantum
fluctuations. They are important when the resistance is small or the
temperature very low. A real-time approach is developed which allows the
diagrammatic classification of ``inelastic resonant tunneling'' processes where
different electrons tunnel coherently back and forth between the leads and the
metallic island. With the help of a nonperturbative resummation technique we
evaluate the spectral density which describes the charge excitations of the
system. From it physical quantities of interest like current and average charge
can be deduced. Our main conclusions are: An energy renormalization leads to a
logarithmic temperature dependence of the renormalized system parameters. A
finite lifetime broadening can change the classical picture drastically. It
gives rise to a strong flattening of the Coulomb oscillations for low
resistances, but in the Coulomb blockade regime inelastic electron cotunneling
persists. The temperature where these effects are important are accessible in
experiments.

discuss generalizations of multigrid methods for disordered systems, in
particular for propagators in lattice gauge theories. A discretized nonabelian
gauge theory can be formulated as a system of statistical mechanics where the
gauge field degrees of freedom are $SU(N)$ matrices on the links of the
lattice. These $SU(N)$ matrices appear as random coefficients in Dirac
equations. We aim at finding an efficient method by which one can solve Dirac
equations without critical slowing down. If this could be achieved, Monte Carlo
simulations of Quantum Chromodynamics (the theory of the strong interaction)
would be accelerated considerably. In principle, however, the methods discussed
can be used in arbitrary space-time dimension and for arbitrary gauge group.
Moreover, there are applications in multigrid Monte Carlo simulations, and for
the definition of block spins and blocked gauge fields in Monte Carlo
renormalization group studies. As a central results it was found that {\em the

way to introduce angular variables in the hamiltonian formulation of QCD. On
the basis of an analysis of Gauss' law constraints a particular choice is made
for the variable transformation from gauge fields to angular field variables.
The resulting formulation is analogous to the one of Bars in terms of corner
variables and it is closely related to the hamiltonian lattice QCD formulation.
Therefore the corner or angle formulation may constitute an useful starting

their properties. In the end we study the $Q$-homomorphisms of the quantum

Calogero-Moser model, which goes to the original model in a continuum limit.
This discrete model is obtained from pole solutions of a semi-discretized
version of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, leading to a finite-dimensional
symplectic mapping. Lax pair, symplectic structure and sufficient set of
invariants of the discrete Calogero-Moser model are constructed for both the
rational and elliptic cases. The classical $r$-matrix is the same as for the
continuum model. An exact solution of the initial value problem is given for
the rational discrete-time Calogero-Moser model. The pole-expansion and
elliptic solutions of the fully discretized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation are
also discussed.

vector gauged model and the axial gauged model are equivalent as $N=(2,2)$
superconformal field theories. In the $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ model, it is known that
axial-vector duality relates a background with a singularity to that without a
singularity. Implications of the equivalence of these two models to space-time

time evolution. We suggest that the mass weighted multiplicity is a suitable
observable for the discovery of scaling. Numerical tests validate such
properties, even for moderate values of the initial mass (nuclei, percolation
clusters, jets of particles etc.). Finite size effects can be simply
parametrized.

hedgehog meson fields in the bosonized two-flavor Nambu \& Jona-Lasinio model.
To remove the spurious motion and to restore good spin and isospin we consider
a boosted and rotating soliton instead a static soliton at rest. Modified meson
fields are obtained by minimizing a corrected effective energy functional. The
importance of the modification is estimated by evaluating expectation values of
several observables. Stabile solitonic configurations are obtained for $M\gapp$
300\,MeV, while static solitons exists for $M\gapp$ 350\,MeV only. Despite the
considerable size of the energy corrections (30-50\% of the soliton energy) the
main features of the static soliton are preserved. Modified meson profiles are
somewhat narrower than static ones and have a different asymptotic behavior,
which depends on the isospin quantum number. The modifications increase with
increasing constituent quark mass. The valence-quark picture dominates up to
very large constituent quark masses. In the physically relevant mass region,
the root-mean square radius of the quark distribution is reduced by less than
10 percent. The $\Delta$--nucleon mass-splitting is still weaker affected.

sum rule. We show that the leading and next-to-leading order terms of the OPE
give rise to the Tomozawa-Weinberg and sigma terms, respectively. We also show
that in the kaon-nucleon system the $\Lambda(1405)$ contribution has to be
subtracted from the OPE side in order to obtain the scattering length. The odd
components of the $T$-matrices are in agreement with the experimental values
not only in the pion-nucleon channel but also in the kaon-nucleon channel after
the $\Lambda(1405)$ contribution subtracted. The even components disagree with
the experimental values in the pion-nucleon channel, which is similar to the
situation in the PCAC-plus-current-algebra approach at the Weinberg point. We
speculate that this discrepancy should be explained by the continuum
contribution in the spectral function above the pion-nucleon threshold.
