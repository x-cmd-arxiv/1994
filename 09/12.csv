microlensing events towards Baade's window in a model composed of a Galactic
disk and a bar. The bar model is a self-consistent dynamical model built out of
individual orbits that has been populated to be consistent with the COBE maps
of the Galaxy and kinematic observations of the Bulge. We find most of the
lenses are at 6.25 kpc in BW. The microlensing optical depth of a 2E10 Msun bar
plus a truncated disk is (2.2+-0.3)E-6, consistent with the very large optical
depth (3.2+-1.2)E-6 found by Udalski et al. (1994). This prediction doubles
that of axisymmetric models by Kiraga and Paczynski (1994) since the bar is
elongated along the line-of-sight. The large Einstein radius and small
transverse velocity dispersion also predict a longer event duration in the bar
model than the KP model. The event rate and duration distribution also depend
on the lower mass cutoff of the lens mass function. With a 0.1Msun cutoff, 5-7
events of typical 20 days duration are expected for the OGLE experiment
according to our model, while Udalski et al. observed 9 events with durations
from 8-62 days. On the other hand, if most of the lenses are brown dwarfs, our
model predicts too many short duration events; a KS test finds only 7%
probability for the model with 0.01Msun cutoff to be consistent with current
data.

limits on dynamo saturation in young solar-type stars. These are inferred from
the increasing amplitude of the V-band optical flux with rotation, caused by
the filling of the disc with surface spots in a non-axisymmetric pattern.
Assuming spot coverage acts as a tracer of the total magnetic surface flux we
find that the magnetic activity saturates at a level at least 6 -- 10 times
greater than that inferred from chromospheric and transition line indicators.
We suggest that these new limits imply a minimum rotation for saturation of the
dynamo and that for high rotation rates starspot coverage acts as an
alternative diagnostic for the stellar dynamo to the chromospheric and
transition region line emission fluxes. The fact that the dynamo does not
appear to saturate at the low rotation rates indicated by chromospheric
indicators should assist evolutionary braking models that have to explain the
sudden spin-down of young fast rotating G-dwarfs. ( + 3 figures, available on

exact solutions to Einstein's equations are obtained: the first class
corresponds to the minimal coupling, the second one to the conformal coupling.
One of the solutions is shown to describe a formation of a black hole in a
cosmological setting. Some properties of this solution are described. There are
two kinds of event horizons: a black hole horizon and cosmological horizons.
The cosmological horizons are not smooth. There is a mild curvature
singularity, which affects extended bodies but allows geodesics to be extended.
It is also shown that there is a critical value for a parameter on which the
solution depends. Above the critical point, the black hole singularity is
hidden within a global black hole event horizon. Below the critical point, the
singularity appears to be naked. The relevance to cosmic censorship is
discussed.

the space of an operad with multiplication is a homotopy G- (i.e., homotopy
graded Poisson) algebra; (2) the singular cochain complex is naturally an
operad; (3) the operad of decorated moduli spaces acts naturally on the de Rham
complex $\Omega^\bullet X$ of a K\""{a}hler manifold $X$, thereby yielding the
most general type of homotopy G-algebra structure on $\Omega^\bullet X$. One of
the reasons to put this operadic nonsense on the physics bulletin board is that
we use a typical construction of supersymmetric sigma-model, the construction

susceptibility exponent agrees for any genus with Liouville theory where the

allows us to define a double-scaling limit of the $g=g_t$ theory. We also
consider matrix models modified by terms of the form $g O^2$, where $O$ is a
