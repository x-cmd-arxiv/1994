"alg-geom/9408011","Robert Lazarsfeld","Robert Lazarsfeld","Lectures on Linear Series","56 pages, AMS Tex 2.1",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  The past decade has witnessed two important new developments in the study of
linear series on algebraic varieties. First, vector bundles have emerged as
powerful tools for analyzing linear series on curves and surfaces. More
recently, the viewpoints and techniques of higher dimensional geometry have
started to play a central role. The purpose of these lectures is to provide a
down-to-earth introduction to some of these new ideas and methods.
  The present notes, written with the assistance of G. Fernandez del Busto, are
a considerably expanded version of a course given at the 1993 Regional Geometry
Institute on Higher Dimensional Complex Geometry at Park City, Utah. While I
hope they may be of interest to any geometers wishing to learn about recent
work on linear series, I have particularly attempted to aim the discusion at a
novice audience. My hope is that with a little faith and effort, these notes
should be accessible to anyone having finished the standard introductory texts
in algebraic geometry. The underlying theme of the lectures is the search for
higher dimensional generalizations of the most basic facts about linear series
on curves. But in an attempt to keep things elementary we work more or less
exclusively on surfaces. Thus we end up discussing one central result -- viz.
Reider's theorem -- from many points of view. Sticking to the case of surfaces
allows one to eliminate many technical complexities, and I hope that parts of
these lectures might therefore serve as a useful first introduction to the
powerful cohomological techniques (involving $Q$-divisors) of contemporary

harmonic spectrum of microwave background fluctuations produced by topological
defects in an open universe. Unlike inflationary models that predict a flat
universe and a spectrum of CBR fluctuations that is enhanced at large angular
scales, defect models predict that CBR fluctuations are suppressed on angular
scales larger than that subtended by the curvature scale. In an $\Omega = 0.2 -
0.4$ universe, these models, when normalized to the amplitude of CBR
fluctuations observed by COBE, require a moderate bias factor, $2-3$, to be
compatible with the observed fluctuations in galaxy counts. In these models,
accurate predictions can be made which are testable through CBR experiments in
the near future. A CBR measurement of $\Omega$ would then be possible, up to
the limit imposed by cosmic variance. We discuss some of the philosophical
implications of an open model and propose a solution to the flatness problem.

not a good fit to models like CDM. Here we normalize standard CDM (sCDM) to the

used measures of power. We also give normalizations for some specific variants
of this standard model, and we indicate how the normalization depends on the
assumed values of n, Omega_B and H_0. For sCDM we find <Q>=19.9\pm1.5uK,

being B=(8.16\pm1.04)\times10^5 (Mpc/h)^4, and other numbers given in the

low relative to this normalization. This is mainly due to the low quadrupole in

comprehension is an incremental and interactive process in which semantic and

informed commitments as early as possible at a local ambiguity. Early
commitments may be made by using top-down guidance from knowledge of different
types, each of which must be applicable independently of others. Further
evidence from studies of error recovery and delayed decisions points toward an
arbitration mechanism for combining syntactic and semantic information in
resolving ambiguities. In order to account for all of the above, we propose
that all types of linguistic knowledge must be represented in a common form but
must be separable so that they can be applied independently of each other and
integrated at processing time by the arbitrator. We present such a uniform
representation and a computational model called COMPERE based on the
representation and the processing strategy.

followed one of two paths. Either the model posited a sequence of processing
modules, each with its own task-specific knowledge (e.g., syntax and
semantics), or it posited a single processor utilizing different types of
knowledge inextricably integrated into a monolithic knowledge base. Our
previous work in modeling the sentence processor resulted in a model in which
different processing modules used separate knowledge sources but operated in
parallel to arrive at the interpretation of a sentence. One highlight of this
model is that it offered an explanation of how the sentence processor might
recover from an error in choosing the meaning of an ambiguous word. Recent
experimental work by Laurie Stowe strongly suggests that the human sentence
processor deals with syntactic error recovery using a mechanism very much like
that proposed by our model of semantic error recovery. Another way to interpret
Stowe's finding is this: the human sentence processor consists of a single
unified processing module utilizing multiple independent knowledge sources in
parallel. A sentence processor built upon this architecture should at times
exhibit behavior associated with modular approaches, and at other times act
like an integrated system. In this paper we explore some of these ideas via a

recent studies of electrons on the surface of helium. We investigate the low

that the low temperature state of the system always has isolated dislocations,

transition from a hexatic glass to an isotropic glass as the disorder is
increased. The former is characterized by quasi-long range orientational order,

latter by short range orientational order and the presence of these defects.

coordinates of the dust particles and the proper time along the dust worldlines
become canonical coordinates in the phase space of the system. The Hamiltonian
constraint can be resolved with respect to the momentum that is canonically
conjugate to the dust time. Imposition of the resolved constraint as an
operator restriction on the quantum states yields a functional Schr\""{o}dinger
equation. The ensuing Hamiltonian density has an extraordinary feature: it
depends only on the geometric variables, not on the dust coordinates or time.
This has three important consequences. First, the functional Schr\""{o}dinger
equation can be solved by separating the dust time from the geometric
variables. Second, the Hamiltonian densities strongly commute and therefore can
be simultaneously defined by spectral analysis. Third, the standard constraint
system of vacuum gravity is cast into a form in which it generates a true Lie
algebra. The particles of dust introduce into space a privileged system of
coordinates that allows the supermomentum constraint to be solved explicitly.
The Schr\""{o}dinger equation yields a conserved inner product that can be
written in terms of either the instantaneous state functionals or the solutions
of constraints. Examples of gravitational observables are given, though neither
the intrinsic metric nor the extrinsic curvature are observables. Disregarding

  http://gluon.physics.wayne.edu/wsuhep/jim/dpf94.ps",,,,"hep-ph",,"  We have investigated the spectra of light-heavy quarkonia with the use of a
quantum-chromodynamic potential model which is similar to that used earlier for
the heavy quarkonia. An essential feature of our treatment is the inclusion of
the one-loop radiative corrections to the quark-antiquark potential, which
contribute significantly to the spin-splittings among the quarkonium energy
levels. Unlike $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$, the potential for a light-heavy
system has a complicated dependence on the light and heavy quark masses $m$ and
$M$, and it contains a spin-orbit mixing term. We have obtained excellent
results for the observed energy levels of $D^0$, $D_s$, $B^0$, and $B_s$, and
we are able to provide predicted results for many unobserved energy levels. We
have also used our investigation to test the accuracy of the heavy quark
effective theory. We find that the heavy quark expansion yields generally good
results for the $B^0$ and $B_s$ energy levels provided that $M^{-1}$ and
$M^{-1}\ln M$ corrections are taken into account in the quark-antiquark
interactions. It does not, however, provide equally good results for the energy
levels of $D^0$ and $D_s$, which shows that the effective theory can be applied
more accurately to the $b$ quark than the $c$ quark.
