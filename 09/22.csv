we show, for the first time for this class of models which violates the the

that the effects of the periodic potential and the disorder decay on very large

${\rm SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y}$ theories is introduced. It separates the 1-loop
corrections into two pieces: process specific ones from vertex and box
contributions, and universal ones from contributions to the gauge boson
propagators. The latter are parametrized in terms of four effective form
factors $\bar{e}^2(q^2)$, $\bar{s}^2(q^2)$, $\bar{g}_Z^2(q^2)$ and $\bar{g}_W^2
(q^2)$ corresponding to the $\gamma\gamma$, $\gamma Z$, $ZZ$ and $WW$
propagators. Under the assumption that only the Standard Model contributes to
the process specific corrections, the magnitudes of the four form factors are
determined at $q^2=0$ and at $q^2=\mmz$ by fitting to all available precision
experiments. These values are then compared systematically with predictions of
${\rm SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y}$ theories. In all fits $\alpha_s(\mz)$ and
$\bar{\alpha}(\mmz)$ are treated as external parameters in order to keep the
interpretation as flexible as possible. The treatment of the electroweak data
is presented in detail together with the relevant theoretical formulae used to
interpret the data. No deviation from the Standard Model has been identified.
Ranges of the top quark and Higgs boson masses are derived as functions of
$\alpha_s(\mz)$ and $\bar{\alpha}(\mmz)$. Also discussed are consequences of
the recent precision measurement of the left-right asymmetry at SLC as well as
the impact of a top quark mass and an improved $W$ mass measurement.

doublet of $SU(2)_L$ and the other a doublet of $SU(2)_R$, have been predicted
to exist in the context of a viable and economical SUSY composite model. One of
the many attractive features of the model is an explanation of the inter-family
mass-hierarchy for which the existence of the two vector-families is crucial.
This paper is devoted to a detailed study of the expected masses, mixings and
decay modes of the fermions belonging to the two vector-like families. The
masses of the vector-like quarks are expected to lie in the range of 500 GeV to
about 2.5 TeV, while those of the vector-like leptons are expected to be in the
range of 200 GeV to 1 TeV. Their mass pattern and decay modes exhibit certain
distinguishing features and characteristic signals. For example, when the LHC
and, possibly a future version of the SSC are built, pair-production of the
vector-like quarks would lead to systems such as ($b\overline{b}+4Z+W^+W^-$)
and ($b\overline{b}+2Z+W^+W^-$), while an $e^-e^+$ linear collider (NLC) of
suitable energy can produce appreciably a single neutral heavy lepton $N$
together with $\nu_\tau$, followed by the decay of $N$ into $(Z+\nu_\tau)
\rightarrow (e^-e^+) + \nu_\tau$. This last signal may conceivably materialize
even at LEP 200 if $N$ is lighter than about 190 GeV.

results in terms of generalized, multivariable hypergeometric functions are
presented giving explicit series for small and large momenta. Secondly the
imaginary parts of these integrals are expressed as complete elliptic
integrals.Finally one-dimensional integral representations with elementary
functions are derived.They are very well suited for the numerical evaluations.

  pages. RevTex",,,,"hep-ph",,"  An effective hamiltonian for heavy quarkonia is derived from QCD by
separating gluonic fields in background and quantum fields and neglecting
anharmonic contributions. Mesonic states with nonperturbative gluonic
components are constructed. These states are invariant under gauge changes of
the background fields and form an orthogonal basis. The effective hamiltonian
is diagonalized in this basis in a systematic $1/m$- and short distance
expansion. For very heavy quarkonia, we obtain an effective potential similar
to the phenomenological funnel potential. We compare our method to $2^{\rm nd}$
order perturbation theory in the background fields and demonstrate its
applicability even for the relatively light charmonium system. The results to
order $1/m$ for pseudoscalar meson masses and wave functions are shown and
compared with those of the Cornell model.

equivalent to special cases of bosonic strings. We explore whether a more
general quantization can lead to new generalized W_3 string theories by seeking
to construct quantum BRST charges directly without requiring the existence of a
quantum W_3 algebra. We study W_3-like strings with a direct spacetime
interpretation---that is, with matter given by explicit free field
realizations. Special emphasis is placed on the attempt to construct a quantum
W-string associated with the magic realizations of the classical w_3 algebra.
We give the general conditions for the existence of W_3-like strings, and
comment how the known results fit into our general construction. Our results
are negative: we find no new consistent string theories, and in particular rule
out the possibility of critical strings based on the magic realizations.
