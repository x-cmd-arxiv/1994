Colors in these bands are constant across the bar of NGC 4314 indicating that
the mass-to-light ratio is constant over much of the galaxy. We have developed
an efficient procedure for mapping the gravitational potential of a
non-axisymmetric galaxy based on its appearance in the near-infrared using a
Fourier Transform method. We account for the thickness of the galaxy's stellar
disk by convolving its $K$ image with a function that depends upon the vertical
stellar scale height. We apply this procedure to NGC 4314 and find that
prograde stellar orbits integrated in the potential are consistent with the
shape of the bar for a disk vertical scale height of $h = 350 \pm 100$ pc and a
corotation radius of $r=3.5 \pm 0.5$ kpc.
  We find that the inner $m=4$ Lindblad resonance is approximately at the
location of knob-like features seen near the end of the bar. The shape of
nearly closed orbits at this radius are lozenge or diamond shaped and have low
speeds along the major axis of the bar. The low speeds imply an increase in
density along the major axis of the bar. The angle of the major axis of the
$m=4$ component of the surface density begins to twist at the location of its
resonance, and the angle of the $m=2$ component begins to twist at a larger
radius near the corotation radius.

inflationary domains may contain values of Planck mass that differ slightly
from their parent's. The selection mechanism establishes that the value of
Planck mass should be such as to increase the proper volume of the inflationary

the best window into flavor physics. Thus, pair--production of top quarks at
the Tevatron Collider is the most incisive probe of this physics until the
Large Hadron Collider turns on in the next century. In this talk I discuss how
moments of the $\ttb$ invariant mass distribution can be used to distinguish
among standard and alternative mechanisms of $\ttb$ production.

anomaly) component of the lagrangian leads to interesting predictions for the
processes pi0 -----> 2 gamma and gamma ----->3 pi. These are described by the
amplitudes F_{pi} and F_{3pi}, respectively. We demonstrate that the O(p4)

consistent. We describe how Fermilab experiment E781 can get improved data for

factorization in non-leptonic heavy meson decays, beyond the leading
logarithmic approximation in three renormalization schemes (NDR, HV, DRED). We
investigate their $\mu$--dependence and the renormalization scheme dependence.
We point out that $a_1$ for B-decays depends very weakly on $\Lms$, $\mu$ and
the choice of the renormalization scheme. For $\Lms^{(5)}=225\pm85~MeV$ and
$4~GeV\leq\mu\leq 8~GeV$ we find $a_1=1.01\pm0.02$ in accordance with
phenomenology. The $\Lms$, $\mu$ and scheme dependences of $a_2$ are on the
other hand sizable. Interestingly, for the NDR scheme we find
$a_2^{NDR}=0.20\pm0.05$, in the ball park of recent phenomenological results
and substantially larger than leading order estimates. However
$a_2^{HV}=0.16\pm0.05$ and $a_2^{DRED}=0.15\pm0.05$. Implications of these
findings for the tests of factorization in B-decays and D-decays are critically
discussed.

of the known fermions with new heavy states. We perform a global analysis
including all the LEP data on the $Z$ decay widths and asymmetries collected

of the $W$ boson mass, various charged current constraints, and the low energy
neutral current experiments. We use a top mass value in the range announced by
CDF. We derive limits on the $Z_0$--$Z_1$ mixing, which are always $\lsim 0.01$
and are at the level of a few {\it per mille} if some specific model is
assumed. Model-dependent theoretical relations between the mixing and the mass
of the new gauge boson in most cases require $M_{Z'} > 1\,$TeV. Limits on
light--heavy fermion mixings are also largely improved with respect to previous
analyses, and are particularly relevant for a class of models that we discuss.

to the case of systems with extended lines of defect. This is done by adding
the reflection and transmission amplitudes for the interactions with the line

condition for the new amplitudes gives rise to a set of Reflection-Transmission
equations. The solutions of these equations in the case of diagonal $S$-matrix
in the bulk are only those with $S =\pm 1$. The choice $S=-1$ corresponds to
the Ising model. We compute the exact expressions of the transmission and
reflection amplitudes relative to the interaction of the Majorana fermion of
the Ising model with the defect. These amplitudes present a weak-strong duality
in the coupling constant, the self-dual points being the special values where
the defect line acts as a reflecting surface. We also discuss the bosonic case
$S=1$ which presents instability properties and resonance states. Multi-defect
systems which may give rise to a band structure are also considered. The exact
expressions of correlation functions is obtained in terms of Form Factors of
