$\sim 60\,\kms$ by making parallax observations of quasars being microlensed by
stars in the disk of the galaxy. To make the measurement, a quasar must be
located behind the disk of the galaxy between about 1 and 2 scale lengths from
the center. The quasar must then be monitored for microlensing events and the
events followed simultaneously from the Earth and a satellite in solar orbit,
preferably at $\sim 30\,$AU. A systematic search in a volume within
$21,000\,\kms$ could locate quasars with $B<23$ behind a total of $\sim 1900$
galaxies. The rate of lensing events (and hence galaxy velocity measurements)
would be $\sim 3\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The events would have typical characteristic
times $\omega^{-1}\sim 3\,$yr. Under the assumption that the mass spectrum of
lensing objects is the same in other spiral galaxies as in our own, the
observations could be used to measure the Hubble parameter to an accuracy of

derived. The exact renormalization group equation involving infinitely many
induced interactions can be rewritten in a form that has a finite number of
coupling constants by taking account of reparametrization identities. Despite
the nonlinearity of the equation, the location of fixed points and the scaling
exponents can be extracted from the equation. They agree with the spectrum of
relevant operators in the exact solution. A linearized $\beta$-function
approximates well the global phase structure which includes several nontrivial
fixed points. The global renormalization group flow suggests a kind of
$c$-theorem in two-dimensional quantum gravity.

equivalent to a resummation of an infinite subclass of graphs in perturbation
theory, which involve fluctuations of the $\chi$ field only. We study the
temperature dependence of the expectation value of the $\phi$ field and the
resulting first and second order phase transitions.

mappings possess a non-ultralocal quantum Yang-Baxter structure leading to the
existence of commuting families of exact quantum invariants. We derive the
associated quantum Miura transformations between these mappings and the
corresponding quantum bi-Hamiltonian structure.
