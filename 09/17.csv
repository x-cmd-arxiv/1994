numerical propagation of light rays through a universe having a distribution of
inhomogeneities derived from the standard CDM (cold dark matter) scenario with
the aid of massive, fully nonlinear computer simulations is used to test the
model. It predicts that we should have seen far more widely split quasar images
than have been found. These and other inconsistencies rule out the COBE
normalized CDM model with $\Omega=1$ and $H_0=50$km/s/Mpc; but variants of this
model might be constructed, which could pass the stringent tests provided by
strong gravitational lensing.

  Remnants","5 pages, uuencoded compressed Postscript, submitted to Astronomy &
  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We propose that some of the unidentified Galactic plane (-10 degrees < b < 10
degrees) sources listed in the first EGRET catalog (Fichtel et al. 1994) are
associated with nearby supernova remnants. The probability that the association
of strong EGRET sources with supernova remnants is due to chance alignment is
found to be < 1/2200. Three of the most convincing associations are
radio-bright, nearby shell remnants and a fourth is associated with a plerion.
  We examine possible gamma-ray production mechanisms and conclude that pion
production and decay from high-energy protons interacting with the remnant gas
could produce the gamma rays.
  The energetics of this process are in accord with theories of cosmic ray
production through supernova shock acceleration.
  The identification of pion-decay features in the gamma-ray spectra of
supernova remnants would support this interpretation.

The system exhibits behavior which combines chaotic motion and attraction to
heteroclinic cycles; the trajectory visits several unstable stationary states
repeatedly with an irregular order, and the typical length of the stay near the
steady states grows exponentially with the number of visits. The dynamics
underlying this irregular motion is analyzed by introducing a dynamically
rescaled time variable, and its relation to the low-dimensional chaotic
dynamics is thus uncovered. The relation of this irregular motion with a
strange type of instability of heteroclinic cycles is also examined.

based on Si $\delta$-doped GaAs. Assuming that $\delta$-doped layers are
equally spaced, quasiperiodicity is introduced by selecting two different donor
concentrations and arranging them according to the Fibonacci series along the
growth direction. The one-electron potential due to $\delta$-doping is obtained
by means of the Thomas-Fermi approach. The resulting energy spectrum is then
found by solving the corresponding effective-mass wave equation. We find that a
self-similar spectrum can be seen in the band structure. Electronic transport
properties of samples are also discussed and related to the degree of spatial
localization of electronic envelope-functions.

more precise definition of self-organized criticality is desirable and
establish several criteria in this connection.

of traveling localized source solutions. These so called 'Nozaki-Bekki holes'
are (dynamically) stable in some parameter range, but always structually
unstable: A perturbation of the equation in general leads to a (positive or
negative) monotonic acceleration or an oscillation of the holes. This confirms
that the cubic CGLE has an inner symmetry. As a consequence small perturbations
change some of the qualitative dynamics of the cubic CGLE and enhance or
suppress spatio-temporal intermittency in some parameter range. An analytic
stability analysis of holes in the cubic CGLE and a semianalytical treatment of
the acceleration instability in the perturbed equation is performed by using
matching and perturbation methods. Furthermore we treat the asymptotic
hole-shock interaction. The results, which can be obtained fully analytically
in the nonlinear Schroedinger limit, are also used for the quantitative
description of modulated solutions made up of periodic arrangements of
traveling holes and shocks.
