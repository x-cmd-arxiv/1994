  Local report# 94915,email: cen@astro.princeton.edu",,"10.1086/187680",,"astro-ph",,"  We determine the velocity correlation function, pairwise peculiar velocity
difference, and root-mean-square pairwise peculiar velocity dispersion of rich
clusters of galaxies, as a function of pair separation, for three cosmological
models: Omega=1 and Omega=0.3 CDM, and Omega=0.3 PBI models (all flat and
COBE-normalized). We find that close cluster pairs, with separation r<10Mpc/h,
exhibit strong attractive peculiar velocities in all models; the cluster
pairwise velocities depend sensitively on the model. The mean pairwise
attractive velocity of clusters on 5Mpc/h scale ranges from 1700 km/s for
Omega=1 CDM, to 1000 km/s for PBI, to 700 km/s for Omega=0.3 CDM. The
small-scale pairwise velocities depend also on cluster mass: richer, more
massive clusters exhibit stronger attractive velocities than less massive
clusters. On large scales, from 20 to 200Mpc/h, the cluster peculiar velocities
are increasingly dominated by bulk and random motions; they are independent of
cluster mass. The cluster velocity correlation function, which reflects the
bulk motion minus the relative motion of pairs, is negative on small scales for
Omega=1 and Omega=0.3 CDM, and positive for PBI; this indicates stronger
pairwise motion than bulk motion on small scales for CDM, and relatively larger
bulk motions for PBI. The cluster velocity correlation function is positive on
very large scales, from 10 to 200Mpc/h, for all models. These positive
correlations, which decrease monotonically with scale, indicate significant
bulk motions of clusters up to 200Mpc/h. The strong dependence of the cluster
velocity functions on models, especially at small separations, makes them
useful tools in constraining cosmological models when compared with
observations.

is not yet established, we simply assume that the gamma-ray burst sources are
associated with high-redshift galaxies in some way. Then on the basis of
several simple models for the evolution of galaxy spatial correlations, we
calculate the amplitude of angular two-point correlation functions on scales
appropriate for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory data. we find that in most
cases the predicted correlations are difficult to detect with the current data
rate and the angular resolution, but models in which the bursts preferentially
occur at relatively low redshift ($z \simlt 0.5$) predict correlation
amplitudes on $\theta \sim 5^\circ$ which will be marginally detectable with
the Gamma Ray Observatory data in several years. If future observations detect
a signal of angular correlations, it will imply useful information on the
correlation of galaxies at high redshifts provided that the gamma-ray bursts
are cosmological.

Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) on the X-ray satellite ROSAT on
1990 July 9-11 and 1992 January 26-27. During the observations, the source was
variable on time scales from a few minutes to several hours, with the X-ray
(0.2-2 keV) luminosity in the range $\sim 2.5-6.8\times 10^{29} erg s^{-1}$. An
X-ray flare-like event, which has a one hour characteristic rise time and a two
hour decay time, was observed from CC Eri on 1990 July 10 16:14-21:34 (UT). The
X-ray spectrum of the source can be described by current thermal plasma codes
with two temperature components or with a continuous temperature distribution.
The spectral results show that plasma at $Te\sim 10^{7}$ K exists in the corona
of CC Eri. The variations in the observed source flux and spectra can be
reproduced by a flare, adopting a magnetic reconnection model. Comparisons with
an unheated model, late in the flare, suggest that the area and volume of the
flare are substantially larger than in a solar two ribbon flare, while the
electron pressure is similar. The emission measure and temperature of the
non-flaring emission, interpreted as the average corona, lead to an electron
pressure similar to that in a well-developed solar active region. Rotational
modulation of a spot related active region requires an unphysically large X-ray
flux in a concentrated area.

requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored
on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two
dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck
area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena.
After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description
of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must
grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The
consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena
of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of
string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole
horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much
more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is
found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory
as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string
model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the
holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires
unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string
theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by
Charles Thorn.

Theorem was originally given by Doubilet, Rota, and Stein. Motivated by an
identity of Rota, we give an identity in a Grassmann-Cayley algebra of step 3,
involving joins and meets alone, which expresses the Theorem of Pappus.

"math/9409217","Emanuel Knill","William Y. C. Chen, Vance Faber, Emanuel Knill","Restricted routing and wide diameter of the cycle prefix network","17 pages",,,"LACES 94C-94-5","math.CO",,"  The cycle prefix network is a Cayley coset digraph based on sequences over an
alphabet which has been proposed as a vertex symmetric communication network.
This network has been shown to have many remarkable communication properties
such as a large number of vertices for a given degree and diameter, simple
shortest path routing, Hamiltonicity, optimal connectivity, and others. These
considerations for designing symmetric and directed interconnection networks
are well justified in practice and have been widely recognized in the research
community. Among the important properties of a good network, efficient routing
is probably one of the most important. In this paper, we further study routing
schemes in the cycle prefix network. We confirm an observation first made from
computer experiments regarding the diameter change when certain links are
removed in the original network, and we completely determine the wide diameter
of the network. The wide diameter of a network is now perceived to be even more
important than the diameter. We show by construction that the wide diameter of
the cycle prefix network is very close to the ordinary diameter. This means
that routing in parallel in this network costs little extra time compared to
ordinary single path routing.

(x_n+z_n+\gamma)(x_n+z_n-\gamma)},\eqno(1)$$ where $z_n=n\delta$ and $\eta$,
$\delta$, $\mu$ and $\gamma$ are constants. In an appropriate limit (1) reduces
to the fourth \p\ (PIV) equation $${\d^2w\over\d z^2} = {1\over2w}\left({\d
w\over\d z}\right)^2+\tfr32w^3 + 4zw^2 + 2(z^2-\alpha)w +{\beta\over
w},\eqno(2)$$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants and (1) is commonly
referred to as the discretised fourth Painlev\'e equation. A suitable
factorisation of (1) facilitates the identification of a number of solutions
which take the form of ratios of two polynomials in the variable $z_n$. Limits
of these solutions yield rational solutions of PIV (2). It is also known that
there exist exact solutions of PIV (2) that are expressible in terms of the
complementary error function and in this article we show that a discrete
analogue of this function can be obtained by analysis of (1).
