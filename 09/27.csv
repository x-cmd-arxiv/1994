Objects (Machos) toward the Galactic bulge: monitor the entire $\sim 300$
square deg of the bulge and tune the search primarily to microlensing events of
bright $M_V\lsim 2$ stars. By employing a small second telescope to follow up
the events detected with low dimensionless impact parameter $\beta\lsim 0.2$,
one could measure the proper motion $\Omega$ of $\sim 10\,\rm yr^{-1}$ events
and significantly constrain $\Omega$ for a similar number. If, in addition, the
events were followed from a Macho parallax satellite, it would be possible to
measure individual masses, distances, and transverse velocities for the events
with proper motions. If a fraction $\xi$ of the bulge is composed of low-mass
objects in the range $10^{-3}\lsim M_{\rm low}/M_\odot\lsim 10^{-1}$, then mass
measurements could be made for $\sim 10(\xi/0.1)(0.01 M_\odot \VEV{M_{\rm
low}^{-1}})\,\rm yr^{-1}$ of these, thus allowing a direct measurement of the
mass function in the sub-stellar range. In the absence of a parallax satellite,
ground-based observations could significantly constrain (but not measure) Macho
parallaxes. These constraints, when combined with the proper-motion
measurements, would in turn constrain the mass, distance, and transverse speed
of the Machos. The proposed strategy should therefore be adopted even before a
parallax satellite is launched.

the galaxy have been singled out deriving geometrical parameters of the fitting

The cD halo is clearly dominant at 45 kpc from the galactic centre and has
exceedingly red colours (g-r = 1.03, g-i = 1.82), about 0.7 mag redder than the

Buzzoni (1989) show that the halo is consistent with a population of unevolved
M-dwarf stars lower than 0.7 M_\odot. The M/L ratio in B for the halo is
estimated to range between 50 and 200 implying a total mass for the cD galaxy

unimportant, we found that the gravitational scatterings by superclusters can

exponential growth of the distance between two rays due to multiple
scatterings. The bending angle of each ray grows through the random walk
process. On the other hand, difference between two rays grows exponentially
while it is small. This exponential growth is caused by coherent scatterings
that two rays suffer, and was neglected in the previous studies. The

induce the relative error of a few percent in the observations for objects at
$z=1$. This estimate has been considered as a fundamental limitation of
accuracy of the angular measurements in the observational cosmology. In
multiple graviational scatterings, bending angle of single ray grows through
the random work process. Gunn (1967) assumed that the difference of nearby rays
also grows through the random walk process. However, distance between nearby
photons grows exponentially because the two rays suffer coherent scatterings by
the same scattering object. This exponential growth continues as long as the
scattering is coherent. In the case of scattering by individual galaxies, the
exponential growth continues until the angular distance reaches an arcminute or
so. The relative error of the angular measurements under an arcminute due to
the exponential growth is $\sim 30\%$ at $z=1$ and exceeds $100\%$ at $z=3$, in
the case that the density parameter of galaxies is 0.2. The effects of clusters
of galaxies or superclusters are more difficult to estimate accurately, but
might be significant. In the case of supercluster the angular measurements up

approach to matrix models for discretized two-dimensional quantum gravity. We
derive exact RG equations by solving the reparametrization identities, which
reduce infinitely many induced interactions to a finite number of them. We find
a nonlinear RG equation and an algorithm to obtain the fixed points and the
scaling exponents. They reproduce the spectrum of relevant operators in the
exact solution. The RG flow is visualized by the linear approximation.

near the horizon is computed in string theory. It is modular invariant and
ultraviolet finite. There is an infrared divergence that signifies an
instability near the event horizon of the black hole. It is due to the
exponential growth of the density of states and the associated Hagedorn
transition characteristic of string theory. It is argued that this divergence
is indicative of a tree level contribution, and the Bekenstein-Hawking-Gibbons
formula for the entropy should be understood in terms of string states stuck
near the horizon.

micro-organisms, {\it i.e.}, ciliated and flagellated motions. Towards
understanding of this fact, we analyze the swimming problem by using
$w_{1+\infty}$ and/or $W_{1+\infty}$ algebras. In the study of the relationship
between these two algebras, there appear the wave functions expressing the
shape of micro-organisms. In order to construct the well-defined quantum
mechanics based on $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the wave functions, essentially
only two different kinds of the definitions are allowed on the hermitian
conjugate and the inner products of the wave functions. These two definitions
are related with the shapes of ciliates and flagellates. The formulation
proposed in this paper using $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the wave functions is
the quantum mechanics of the fluid dynamics where the stream function plays the
role of the Hamiltonian. We also consider the area-preserving algebras which
arise in the swimming problem of micro-organisms in the two dimensional fluid.
These algebras are larger than the usual $w_{1+\infty}$ and $W_{1+\infty}$
algebras. We give a free field representation of this extended $W_{1+\infty}$
algebra.

more nonlocality and/or three-body potential effects than predicted from
Nijmegen phase shifts and boson exchange models. The local pion-nucleon S_31,
