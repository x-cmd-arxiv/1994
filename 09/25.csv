gauge theories is examined with new features emphasized. An explicit one loop
analysis in the electroweak theory shows that the method can be consistently
implemented in the on-shell renormalization scheme, and that the choice of the
background gauge cannot be arbitrary and must be fixed in the Landau gauge if
one calculates scattering amplitudes involving unphysical Goldstone bosons.
Some possible applications are also briefly indicated.

and Lee on the renormalization of composite operators. We do this by
considering physical matrix elements with the operators inserted at non-zero
momentum. The resulting IR singularities are regulated dimensionally. We show
that the physical matrix element of the BRST exact gauge variant operator which
appears in the energy- momentum tensor is zero. We then show that the physical
matrix elements of the classical energy-momentum tensor and the gauge invariant
twist two gluon operator are independent of the gauge fixing parameter. A
Sudakov factor appears in the latter cases. The universality of this factor and
the UV finiteness of the energy-momentum tensor provide another method of
finding the anomalous dimension of the gluon operator. We conjecture that this
method applies to higher loops and takes full advantage of the triangularity of
the mixing matrix.

1994) It is shown that among the orthogonal sets of EPR (completely entangled)
states there is a unique basis (up to equivalence) that is a also a perfectly
resolved set of coherent states with respect to a pair of complementary
observables. This basis defines a lattice phase space in which quadratic
Hamiltonians constructed from the observables induce site-to-site hopping at
discrete time intervals. When recently suggested communication
schemes\cite{BENa} are adapted to the lattice they are greatly enhanced,
because the finite Heisenberg group structure allows dynamic generation of
signal sequences using the quadratic Hamiltonians. We anticipate the
possibility of interferometry by determining the relative phases between
successive signals produced by the simplest Hamiltonians of this type, and we
show that they exhibit a remarkable pattern determined by the number-theoretic
Legendre symbol.
