to a pair of $W$ bosons is weaker than the corresponding Standard Model
coupling, provided the Higgs arises from electroweak doublets only. This is
partly due to the effects of the nonlinear realization of the chiral symmetries
at the compositeness scale.

broken phases using discrete light-front quantization. We calculate the
perturbative solution of the zero-mode constraint equation for both the
symmetric and broken phases and show that standard renormalization of the
theory yields finite results. We study the perturbative zero-mode contribution
to two diagrams and show that the light-front formulation gives the same result
as the equal-time formulation. In the broken phase of the theory, we obtain the
nonperturbative solutions of the constraint equation and confirm our previous
speculation that the critical coupling is logarithmically divergent. We discuss
the renormalization of this divergence but are not able to find a satisfactory
nonperturbative technique. Finally we investigate properties that are
insensitive to this divergence, calculate the critical exponent of the theory,
and find agreement with mean field theory as expected.

world-sheet supersymmetry are reviewed. String theory constraints form, in
general, a non-linear quasi(super)conformal algebra, and can have conformal
dimensions $\geq 1$. When $N=4$, the most general $N=4$ quasi-superconformal
algebra to consider for string theory building is $\hat{D}(1,2;\a)$, whose
linearisation is the so-called `large' $N=4$ superconformal algebra. The
$\hat{D}(1,2;\a)$ algebra has $\Hat{su(2)}_{k^+}\oplus
\Hat{su(2)}_{k^-}\oplus\Hat{u(1)}$ Ka\v{c}-Moody component, and $\a=k^-/k^+$.
We check the Jacobi identities and construct a BRST charge for the
$\hat{D}(1,2;\a)$ algebra. The quantum BRST operator can be made nilpotent only
when $k^+=k^-=-2$. The $\hat{D}(1,2;1)$ algebra is actually isomorphic to the
$SO(4)$-based Bershadsky-Knizhnik non-linear quasi-superconformal algebra. We
argue about the existence of a string theory associated with the latter, and
propose the (non-covariant) hamiltonian action for this new $N=4$ string
theory. Our results imply the existence of two different $N=4$ fermionic string
theories: the old one based on the `small' linear $N=4$ superconformal algebra
and having the total ghost central charge $c_{\rm gh}=+12$, and the new one
with non-linearly realised $N=4$ supersymmetry, based on the $SO(4)$
quasi-superconformal algebra and having $c_{\rm gh}=+6$. Both critical string
theories have negative `critical dimensions' and do not admit unitary matter
representations.

background. Using dimensional reduction, one finds that the extremal electric
dilatonic black holes and their recently discovered generalizations with NUT
