luminosity well beyond $z\sim 1$, the redshift at which many of the standard
techniques break down. We summarize the principal results for our completed
survey at $z \le 1$, and give the preliminary results of a second survey

discuss both the techniques involved and the implications of the results.

the sampling variance arising from the finite size of our simulations dominates

  included, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics, MPA 832",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The reconstruction of the density profile in clusters of galaxies from the
distortion of the images of faint background galaxies is reconsidered. The
inversion formula of Kaiser \& Squires is known to provide a quantitative way
to perform this reconstruction; however, the practical application of this
formula faces two problems of principle (besides problems related to the
analysis of the observational data): (1) the shear distribution of a lens
cannot be inferred from the distortion of images, but only a combination of
shear and surface mass density can be observed. (2) The inversion formula is
exact only if one assumes observational data on the whole lens plane, whereas
in reality, the size of the data field is limited by the size of the CCD. We
have considered a possible solution to the first problem in a previous paper.
Here we consider the second problem. It is shown that the application of the
inversion formula to a finite data field induces systemmatic boundary effects.
An alternative inversion formula is derived, based on some recently published
results by Kaiser. We demonstrate, using synthetic data, that this new
inversion formula which does not require an extrapolation of the data beyond
the observed region, yields results which are comparable with those from the
Kaiser \& Squires inversion in their `noise levels', but lack the systemmatic
boundary effects.

gluonic correlators are analyzed by means of an observable that minimizes
finite size effects. Screening of the topological charge is established. This
allows us to calculate the $\eta'$ mass without having to invert the Dirac
operator. We suggest that this method might be used in lattice QCD calculations
as well. Our results for the screening of the topological charge are in
agreement with the chiral Ward identities, and the scalar gluonic correlator
satisfies a low energy theorem first derived by Novikov et al.

the distance from a critical coupling. In this paper we apply this
approximation to determining the equation of state of a gas of vortices in the
Abelian Higgs model. We derive a virial expansion using certain known integrals
of the metric, and the second virial coefficient is calculated, determining the
behaviour of the gas at low densities. A formula for determining higher order
coefficients is given. At low densities and temperatures $T \gg \l$ the
equation of state is of the Van der Waals form $(P+b\frac{N^{2}}{A^{2}})(A-aN)
