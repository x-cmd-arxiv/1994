"gr-qc/9409018","Lau Yun-kau","Y.K.Lau","How Objective is Black Hole Entropy?","Latex file, 10 pages",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The objectivity of black hole entropy is discussed in the particular case of
a Schwarzchild black hole. Using Jaynes' maximum entropy formalism and
Euclidean path integral evaluation of partition function, it is argued that in
the semiclassical limit when the fluctutation of metric is neglected, the black
hole entropy of a Schwarzchild black hole is equal to the maximal information
entropy of an observer whose sole knowledge of the black hole is its mass.
Black hole entropy becomes a measure of number of its internal mass eigenstates
in accordance with the Boltzmann principle only in the limit of negligible
relative mass fluctutation. {}From the information theoretic perspective, the
example of a Schwarzchild black hole seems to suggest that black hole entropy
is no different from ordinary thermodynamic entropy. It is a property of the
experimental data of a black hole, rather than being an intrinsic physical
property of a black hole itself independent of any observer. However, it is
still weakly objective in the sense that different observers given the same set
of data of a black hole will measure the same maximal information entropy.

products is divided into 2 parts. In the first one we recast star products in a
more abstract form as deformations and review its recent developments. The
second part starts with a rapid presentation of standard quantum group theory
and its problems, then moves to their completion by introduction of suitable
Montel topologies well adapted to duality. Preferred deformations (by star
products and unchanged coproducts) of Hopf algebras of functions on compact
groups and their duals, are of special interest. Connection with the usual
models of quantum groups and the quantum double is then presented.
