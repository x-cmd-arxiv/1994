the two-dimensional transfer function, we identify a number of characteristic

of weak friction and noise in time-independent, nonintegrable potentials which
admit both regular and stochastic orbits. The aim is to understand the
qualitative effects of internal and external irregularities associated, e.g.,
with discreteness effects or couplings to an external environment, which stars
in any real galaxy must experience. The two principal conclusions are: (1)
These irregularities can be important on time scales much shorter than the
natural relaxation time scale t_R associated with the friction and noise. For
stochastic orbits friction and noise induce an average exponential divergence
from the unperturbed Hamiltonian trajectory at a rate set by the value of the
local Lyapunov exponent. Even weak noise can make a pointwise interpretation of
orbits suspect already on time scales much shorter than t_R. (2) The friction
and noise can also have significant effects on the statistical properties of
ensembles of stochastic orbits, these also occurring on time scales much
shorter than t_R. Potential implications for galactic dynamics are discussed,
including the problem of shadowing.

rules according to which, there exits a class of CA rules (called Class 4)
which exhibit complex pattern formation and long-lived dynamical activity (long

Class 4 rules are Universal Turing machines i.e. they are bases for
computational universality. We describe an embedding of a ``small'' universal
Turing machine due to Minsky, into a cellular automaton rule-table. This
produces a collection of $(k=18,r=1)$ cellular automata, all of which are
computationally universal. However, we observe that these rules are distributed
amongst the various Wolfram classes. More precisely, we show that the
identification of the Wolfram class depends crucially on the set of initial
conditions used to simulate the given CA. This work, among others, indicates
that a description of complex systems and information dynamics may need a new
framework for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

studies of CP-violation, $B^0 -\overline{B^0}$ mixing, and the underlying
$b$-decay mechanisms. Methods of $b$ ``flavor tagging"" are broadly divided into
``opposite $b$"" tagging and self-tagging of the signal $b$ hadron. The former,
while understood, has the perceived drawback of low efficiency. The latter,
while having the potential for an order of magnitude higher efficiency, has yet
to be demonstrated for neutral $B$ hadrons. In this article we review opposite
$b$ tagging in light of methods whose efficacy has only recently been
demonstrated or suggested. In addition, we recommend a number of tagging
methods for the opposite $b$ including: $K^{*0}$ and $K^{*\pm}$ with large
inclusive yields of 15\% and 18\%; $\overline \Lambda$ and $\overline
{\Lambda}p $; partially reconstructed charmed hadrons; sophisticated jet charge
techniques, etc. We also recommend the use of self-tagging for the $opposite$
$b$ hadron. Such an inversion of self-tagging could conceivably increase the
efficiency of opposite $b$ tagging and even mitigate the effects of neutral $B$
mixing. Self-tagging of the signal hadron, when possible, could be used either
by itself or to confirm the result from the opposite $b$ tag. We suggest that
all methods be weighted by their dilutions and combined to yield efficient
tagging. For a given detector, this requires that the dilution of each tag be
well measured. We therefore review the determination of the dilution $D_T$ for
a general tag $T$ in some detail. Finally, we briefly consider $B$ sector and
suggest a number of exclusive modes which can be combined for higher statistics
probes of the unitarity angles. While ambitious from an experimental
perspective, the program of flavor identification outlined here has the
potential to yield important fundamental results in the near future.

often stated in the literature we show that the Lorentz $\kappa$-anomaly gets
contributions from the integration over both the fermionic {\it and\/} bosonic
degrees of freedom of the string. A careful analysis of the absolute
coefficients of all these anomalies reveals that they can be absorbed by
setting $dH={\alpha'\over4}(\trace F^2-\trace R^2)$, where $\alpha'$ is the
string tension, the expected result. We show that this relation ensures also
the absence of gauge and Lorentz anomalies in the sigma-model effective action.
We evidenciate the presence of infrared divergences.

manifest itself in the low energy theory, which has unscreened spinor color
sources and global $Z_2$ flux tubes. We construct the flux tubes and show how
they mediate the confinement of spinor sources. We further examine the flux
tubes' quantum stability, spectrum and interactions. We find that flux tubes
are Alice strings, despite ambiguities in defining parallel transport.
Furthermore, twisted loops of flux tube support skyrmion number, just as gauged
Alice strings form loops that support monopole charge. This model, while
phenomenologically nonviable, thus affords a perspective on both the dynamics
of confinement and on subtleties which arise for global Alice strings.

spacetime supersymmetry can be broken in string theory while preserving the
finiteness of string amplitudes, and explains how the requirements of modular
invariance and absence of physical tachyons affect the distribution of states
throughout the string spectrum.

method to be legitimated. We also point out that the discretized form of path
integral is indispensable, in other words, the continuum path integral
expression leads us to a wrong result. Therefore a great care must be taken
when some geometrical action would be adopted, even if it is so beautiful, as
the starting ingredient of path integral.

condition of maslessness is a sum of two independent chiral superfields with
each of them corresponding to finite superspin. A translationally covariant, in
general bijective correspondence between harmonic and massless superfields is
constructed. By calculation of the commutation function it is shown that in the
considered approach only harmonic fields with correct connection between spin
and statistics and with integer negative homogeneity index satisfy the
microcausality condition. It is emphasized that harmonic fields that arise are
reducible at integer points. The index spinor technique is used to describe
infinite-component fields of finite spin; the equations of motion of such

massless helicity particles and the type of nongauge field that describes them
