  No. 35",,"10.1086/175769",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a method for simulating numerically the effect of the adiabatic
growth of black holes on the structure of elliptical galaxies. Using a parallel
self--consistent field code, we add black holes to N--body realizations of
model distribution functions for spherical galaxies, using a continuous
mass--spectrum. The variable particle mass, combined with a simple multiple
timestep integration scheme, makes it possible to evolve the models for many
dynamical times with $N \sim 10^6-10^8$, allowing high spatial and mass
resolution. This paper discusses verification of the code using analytic models
for spherical galaxies, comparing our numerical results of the effect of
central black holes on the structure of the galaxies with previously published
models. The intrinsic and projected properties of the final particle
distribution, including higher order moments of the velocity distribution,
permit comparison with observed characteristics of real galaxies, and constrain
the masses of any central black holes present in those galaxies. Our technique
is promising and is easily extended to axisymmetric and triaxial galaxies.

cosmological structure simulation, we study algorithms used to identify groups
of galaxies in redshift space. Two algorithms are investigated; both are
friends-of-friends schemes with variable linking lengths in the radial and
transverse dimensions. The chief difference between the algorithms is in the
redshift linking length. The algorithm proposed by Huchra \& Geller (1982) uses
a generous linking length designed to find ``fingers of god'' while that of
Nolthenius \& White (1987) uses a smaller linking length to minimize
contamination by projection.
  We find that neither of the algorithms studied is intrinsically superior to
the other; rather, the ideal algorithm as well as the ideal algorithm
parameters depend on the purpose for which groups are to be studied. The
Huchra/Geller algorithm misses few real groups, at the cost of including some
spurious groups and members, while the Nolthenius/White algorithm misses high
velocity dispersion groups and members but is less likely to include
interlopers in its group assignments.
  In a companion paper we investigate the accuracy of virial mass estimates and
clustering properties of groups identified using these algorithms.

  We find that groups in a CDM model have excessively large mass to light

shown to describe hydrogen induced reconstruction on the W(100) surface. Based
on mean-field and renormalization group arguments,we first show how the
interplay between the anisotropy fields can give rise to different phase
transitions in the model. When the fields are compatible with each other there
is a continuous phase transition when the fourth order field is varied from
negative to positive values. This transition becomes discontinuous at low
temperatures. These two regimes are separated by a multicritical point. In the
case of competing four and eight fold fields, the first order transition at low
temperatures opens up into two Ising transitions. We then use numerical methods
to accurately locate the position of the multicritical point, and to verify the
nature of the transitions. The different techniques used include Monte Carlo
histogram methods combined with finite size scaling analysis, the real space
Monte Carlo Renormalization Group method, and the Monte Carlo Transfer Matrix
method. Our numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical
arguments.

poor account of the decays B into J/psi + K(*). Usually there is a free overall
factor, which is fit to the data, so that tests of the models rely upon ratios.
The models tend to give too much K* compared to K and too much transverse
polarization compared to longitudinal. Our microscopic calculations, which use
perturbative QCD, do well for both ratios. A microscopic calculation allows us
to see how well factorization, heavy quark symmetry, and other features of
various models are working. In the present case, agreement with the
experimental ratios is dependent upon a breakdown of factorization for one of
the amplitudes.

longitudinal response functions. The transforms are calculated from localized
bound-state-type solutions to an inhomogenous Schr\""odinger-type three-body
equation. Several versions of local $s$-wave spin-dependent potentials
supplemented with a singlet $p$-wave potential and with the proton-proton
Coulomb interaction are used as a two-nucleon input. The conventional charge
density operator is utilized. The three-body equations are solved with a high
acuracy. It is found that the contribution of the $T=3/2$ final states to the
problem is suppressed and it amounts about 15\%. This might be ascribed to
symmetry requirements. The contributions of the $p$-wave $NN$ interaction and
of the Coulomb interaction are found to amount several per cent. Uncertainty
due to different choices of $s$-wave $NN$ forces is of a similar magnitude
provided that the low-energy $NN$ data are properly described. The results are
compared with the integral transforms of the experimental response functions.
For $q=300$ MeV/c experimental and theoretical results coincide within their
uncertainties. For $q=500$ MeV/c a noticeable difference is detected.
