  Herstmonceux Conference Proceedings",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The origin and evolution of structure in the Universe is one of the major
questions occupying astronomers today. An understanding of the Lyalpha
absorbers seen in QSO spectra is an important part of this program since such
absorbers can be traced back to very high redshifts. Their mere existence
places constraints on the physical state of the intergalactic medium. The
discovery of Lyalpha absorbers at low redshift allows us to estimate for the
first time what fraction of low redshift Lyalpha absorbers are (i) randomly
distributed, (ii) distributed like galaxies but not physically associated with
luminous objects, (iii) actually part of the halos of luminous galaxies, or
(iv) tidal tails within galaxy groups. Results from the sightline to the QSO
3C273 suggest that the majority of the absorbers are not associated with
galaxies, but that there is a significant subset that are. The absorbers
associated with galaxies may be produced in enormous gaseous disks surrounding
normal spiral galaxies, or may be tidal material bound up in small groups of
galaxies

  Lick-40",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We use numerical models which include star formation to analyze the mass
profiles of remnants formed by mergers of disk galaxies. During a merger,
dissipation in gas and ensuing star formation leave behind a dense stellar core
in the remnant. Rather than joining smoothly onto a de Vaucouleurs profile, the
starburst population leads to a sharp break in the surface density profile at a
few percent the effective radius. While our results are preliminary, the lack
of such signatures in most elliptical galaxies suggests that mergers of
gas-rich disk galaxies may not have contributed greatly to the population of
present-day ellipticals.

X-ray properties of galaxy clusters in a Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM) model.
We have performed a hydrodynamic plus N-body simulation for the COBE-compatible
CHDM model with standard mass components: Omega(hot) = 0.3, Omega(cold) = 0.6
and Omega(baryon) = 0.1 (h = 0.5). In contrast with the CDM model, which fails
to reproduce the observed temperature distribution function dN/dT (Bryan et al.
1994b), the CHDM model fits the observational dN/dT quite well. Our results on
X-ray luminosity are less firm but even more intriguing. We find that the
resulting X-ray luminosity functions at redshifts z = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7 are
well fit by observations, where they overlap. The fact that both temperatures
and luminosities provide a reasonable fit to the available observational data
indicates that, unless we are missing some essential physics, there is neither
room nor need for a large fraction of gas in rich clusters: 10% (or less) in
baryons is sufficient to explain their X-ray properties. We also see a tight
correlation between X-ray luminosity and gas temperature.

  Arizona, USA",,,,"astro-ph",,"  (\rl = Richardson-Lucy) We propose a simulation-based bootstrap method to
access global significance levels of deconvolution models in the \rl and other
iterative restoration algorithms that converge locally. These significance
levels allow one to check at each iterative step how good the model is and when
iterations can be stopped. Adding more iterations in the deconvolution improves
the fitting but is very slow at later time; while too much entropy or
smoothness will be lost in the models. A good deconvolution model should
firstly have a significance level as high as possible ($\ge$ 20\%), and
secondly, be as smooth as possible. We have used two examples to illustrate how
such models can be derived in practice. We point out that maximizing the sum of
the likelihood of fitting and {\em a priori} entropy does not guarantee an
acceptable significance level for the resulting model. If one's {\em a priori}
knowledge is too poor, the model may not be able to fit the data at a
reasonable significance level. Instead, a maximum-entropy-like iterative
restoration algorithm can be performed later by acquiring {\em a priori}
knowledge from the \rl restoration. However, this is necessary only when it
does increase the levels significantly.

by constant factors. I also examine a variety of biasing models in which the

they provide a particularly good fit between the adsorbate geometry and the

ordered submonolayer adsorbate phases in a range of electrode potential

both systems the ordered-phase region is separated from the adsorbed- hydrogen

gravitational collapse of a spherical inhomogeneous dust cloud. Such a collapse
is described by the Tolman-Bondi metric which has two free functions: the
`mass-function' and the `energy function', which are determined by the initial
density and velocity profile of the cloud. The collapse can end in a black-hole
or a naked singularity, depending on the initial parameters characterizing
these profiles. In the marginally bound case, we find that the collapse ends in
a naked singularity if the leading non-vanishing derivative of the density at
the center is either the first one or the second one. If the first two
derivatives are zero, and the third derivative non-zero, the singularity could
either be naked or covered, depending on a quantity determined by the third
derivative and the central density. If the first three derivatives are zero,
the collapse ends in a black hole. In particular, the classic result of
Oppenheimer and Snyder, that homogeneous dust collapse leads to a black hole,
is recovered as a special case. Analogous results are found when the cloud is
not marginally bound, and also for the case of a cloud starting from rest. We
also show how the strength of the naked singularity depends on the density and
velocity distribution. Our analysis generalizes and simplifies the earlier work
of Christodoulou and Newman [4,5] by dropping the assumption of evenness of
density functions. It turns out that relaxing this assumption allows for a
smooth transition from the naked singularity phase to the black-hole phase, and
also allows for the occurrence of strong curvature naked singularities.

The relevant noncritical $W_3$-string is characterized by a Liouville sector
which is restricted to a (non-unitary) $(3,2)$ $W_3$ minimal model with central
charge contribution $c_l = - 2$. Furthermore, the matter sector of this
$W_3$-string contains $26$ free scalars which realize a critical bosonic
string. The BRST operator for this $W_3$-string can be written as the sum of
two, mutually anticommuting, nilpotent BRST operators: $Q = Q_0 + Q_1$ in such
a way that the scalars which realize the bosonic string appear only in $Q_0$
while the central charge contribution of the fields present in $Q_1$ equals
zero. We argue that, in the simplest case that the Liouville sector is given by

potential is studied from the classical and quantum mechanical view point.
Whereas the problem is nonintegrable, the quantum mechanical spectrum
nevertheless shows some shell structure in the superdeformed prolate case for
particular, yet fairly large octupole strengths; for spherical or oblate
deformation the shell structure disappears. This result is associated with
classical periodic orbits which are found by employing the removal of
resonances method; this approximation method allows determination of the shape
of the orbit and of the approximate octupole coupling strength for which it
occurs. The validity of the method is confirmed by solving numerically the
classical equations of motion. The quantum mechanical shell structure is
analysed using the particle number dependence of the fluctuating part of the
total energy. In accordance with the classical result this dependence turns out
to be very similar for a superdeformed prolate potential plus octupole term and
a hyperdeformed prolate potential without octupole term. In this way the shell
structure is explained at least for some few hundred levels. The Fourier
transform of the level density further corroborates these findings.

occurrence of shell structures and classical periodic orbits is studied using

the frequencies of the classical trajectories are easily determined. It turns
out that the winding numbers calculated in this way are in good agreement with
the ones found from the corresponding quantum mechanical spectrum using the
particle number dependence of the fluctuating part of the total energy. When
the octupole term is switched on it is found that prolate shapes are stable
against chaos whereas spherical and oblate cases become chaotic. An attempt is
made to explain this difference in the quantum mechanical context by looking at
the distribution of exceptional points which results from the matrix structure
of the respective Hamiltonians. In a similar way we analyse the modified
