instability in accretion disks surrounding black holes has been investigated.
The viscous stress is assumed to be proportional to the gas pressure only,
i.e.\,, $\tau = - \alpha p_g$. It is found that an oscillatory instability
exists in the inner regions of disks ($r < 10 r_g$, where $r_g$ is the
Schwarzschild radius) for sufficiently large $\alpha$ ($\gapprox 0.2$), and for
mass accretion rates less than about 0.3 times the Eddington value. The
variations of the integrated bolometric luminosity from the disk, $\Delta L/L$,
are less than 3\%. A power spectrum analysis of these variations reveals a
power spectrum which can be fit to a power law function of the frequency $P
\propto f^{-\gamma}$, with index $\gamma \sim 1.4-2.3$ and a low frequency
feature at about 4 Hz in one case. In addition, a narrow peak centered at a
frequency corresponding to the maximum epicyclic frequency of the disk at $\sim
100-130$ Hz and its first harmonic is also seen. The low frequency modulations
are remarkably similar to those observed in black hole candidate systems. The
possible existence of a scattering corona in the inner region of the disk
and/or to other processes contributing to the power at high frequencies in the
inner region of the accretion disk may make the detection of the high frequency
component difficult.

of turbulence, called the GOY model. This set of equations describes a one
dimensional cascade of energy towards higher wave vectors. When the model is
chaotic, the high-wave-vector velocity is a product of roughly independent
multipliers, one for each logarithmic momentum shell. The appropriate tool for
studying the multifractal properties of this model is shown to be the energy
current on each shell rather than the velocity on each shell. Using this
quantity, one can obtain better measurements of the deviations from Kolmogorov
scaling (in the GOY dynamics) than were available up to now. These deviations
are seen to depend upon the details of inertial-range structure of the model
and hence are {\em not} universal. However, once the conserved quantities of
the model are fixed to have the same scaling structure as energy and helicity,
these deviations seem to depend only weakly upon the scale parameter of the
model. We analyze the connection between multifractality in the velocity
distribution and multifractality in the dissipation. Our arguments suggest that
the connection is universal for models of this character, but the model has a
different behavior from that of real turbulence. We also predict the scaling
behavior of time correlations of shell-velocities, of the dissipation,

it approaches its known T=0 value $c_0$. Despite this temperature dependent
spin-wave velocity, full q- and $\omega$-dependences of the dynamical
susceptibility $\chi(\bf q,\omega)$ agree with the universal scaling functions
computable for the $\sigma$-model, for temperatures upto $T_0 \sim 0.6c_0/a$.
Detailed comparisons show that below $T_0$ the S=1 model is in the renormalized
classical (RC) regime, the two plane model is in the quantum critical (QC)
regime, and the S=1/2 model exhibits a RC-QC crossover, centered at T=0.55J. In
particular, for the S=1/2 model above this crossover and for the two-plane

QC prediction, $m\simeq 1.04\,T$. In contrast, for the S=1/2 model below the

known RC expression. For all models nonuniversal behavior occurs above $T\sim

the homogeneous spaces of quantum groups, the quantum hyperboloid qH and the
quantum plane qP are determined as homogeneous spaces of Fq(E(2)). The
canonical action of Eq(2) is used to define a natural q-analog of the free
Schro""dinger equation, that is studied in the momentum and angular momentum
bases. In the first case the eigenfunctions are factorized in terms of products
of two q-exponentials. In the second case we determine the eigenstates of the
unitary representation, which, in the qP case, are given in terms of Hahn-Exton
functions. Introducing the universal T-matrix for Eq(2) we prove that the
Hahn-Exton as well as Jackson q-Bessel functions are also obtained as matrix
elements of T, thus giving the correct extension to quantum groups of well
known methods in harmonic analysis.

space-time from a single scalar field or a spinor field in higher dimensions.
The Born-Oppenheimer treatment of the extra dimensions is an essential
ingredient in our approach. A possible applications of the idea to low
dimensional condensed matter systems and high temperature field theory are also
pointed out. This paper is an extended version of our previous unpublished work
  (SUNY-NTG-89-48, Jan. 1990).

structure for the mapping class group of a once-punctured, oriented surface
$S$. We describe a quadratic time algorithm for the word problem in this group,
which can be implemented efficiently with pencil and paper. The input of the
algorithm is a word, consisting of ``chord diagrams'' of ideal triangulations
and elementary moves, which represents an element of the mapping class group.
The output is a word called a ``normal form'' that uniquely represents the same
group element.
