disambiguation is presented. The approach presented bases associations upon
thesaurus categories. Association data is gathered from unambiguous cases
extracted from a corpus and is then applied to the analysis of ambiguous
compound nouns. While the work presented is still in progress, a first attempt
to syntactically analyse a test set of 244 examples shows 75% correctness.
Future work is aimed at improving this accuracy and extending the technique to
assign semantic role information, thus producing a complete interpretation.

functional. Changing the temperature (or the inherent noise of the deposition
process) two different regimes with a transition between them at $T_{sr}$, are
found: for $T>T_{sr}$ this term is irrelevant and the surface has the scaling
properties of a surface growing on a flat substrate in the rough phase. The
height-height correlations behave as $C(L,\tau)\sim \ln [L f(\tau/L^2)]$. While
the linear response mobility is finite in this phase it does vanish as
$(T-T_{sr})^{1.78}$ when $T\rightarrow T_{sr}^+$. For $T<T_{sr}$ there is a
line of fixed-point for the coupling constant. The surface is super-rough: the
equilibrium correlation functions behave as $(\ln L)^2$ while their short time
dependence is $(\ln \tau) ^2$ with a temperature dependent dynamic exponent
$z=2[1+1.78(1-T/T_{sr})]$. While the linear response mobility vanishes on large
length scales, its scale-dependence leads to a non-linear response. For a small
applied force $F$ the average velocity of the surface $v$ behaves as $v \sim
F^{1+\zeta}$. To first order $\zeta=1.78(1-T/T_{sr})$. At the transition,
$v\sim F/(1+C|\ln (F)|)^{1.78}$ and the crossover to the behavior to $T<T_{sr}$

dynamic s for a broad class of quantum Hall fluids at filling factor $\nu
=n/(np+1)$, for integer $n$ and even integer $p$. When $p$ is positive all $n$
of the edge modes are expected to move in the same direction, whereas for
negative $p$ one mode moves in a direction opposite to the other $n-1$ modes.
Using a chiral-Luttinger model to describe the edge channels, we show that for
an ideal edge when $p$ is negative, a non-quantized and non-universal Hall
conductance is predicted. The non-quantized conductance is associated with an
absence of equilibration between the $n$ edge channels. To explain the robust
experimental Hall quantization, it is thus necessary to incorporate impurity
scattering into the model, to allow for edge equilibration. A perturbative
analysis reveals that edge impurity scattering is relevant and will modify the
low energy edge dynamics. We describe a non-perturbative solution for the
random $n-$channel edge, which reveals the existence of a new
disorder-dominated phase, characterized by a stable zero temperature
renormalization group fixed point. The phase consists of a single propagating
charge mode, which gives a quantized Hall conductance, and $n-1$ neutral modes.
The neutral modes all propagate at the same speed, and manifest an exact SU(n)
symmetry. At finite temperatures the SU(n) symmetry is broken and the neutral
modes decay with a finite rate which varies as $T^2$ at low temperatures.
Various experimental predictions and implications which follow from the exact
solution are described in detail, focusing on tunneling experiments through
point contacts.

contain additional soft hadronic jets from gluon bremsstrahlung off the quarks
and gluons in the hard processes $\qq, gg \to \tt \to \bb \ww$. These extra
jets can cause complications when attempting to reconstruct $m_t$ from the
invariant mass of combinations of final-state quarks and leptons. We show how
such soft radiation cannot be unambiguously associated with either
initial-state radiation or or with final-state radiation off the $b$ quarks.
The top quarks can radiate too, and in fact the pattern of radiation has a very
rich structure, which depends on the orientation of the final-state particles
with respect to each other and with respect to the beam. We calculate the full
radiation pattern of soft jets in the soft gluon approximation and compare with
several approximate forms which are characteristic of parton shower Monte
Carlos. The implications for top mass measurements are discussed.

convection in binary liquid mixtures, the interaction of fronts is investigated
in a real Ginzburg-Landau equation which is coupled to a mean field. In that
system the Ginzburg-Landau equation describes the traveling-wave amplitude and
the mean field corrsponds to a concentration mode which arises due to the
slowness of mass diffusion. For single fronts the mean field can lead to a
hysteretic transition between slow and fast fronts. Its contribution to the
interaction between fronts can be attractive as well as repulsive and depends
strongly on their direction of propagation. Thus, the concentration mode leads
to a new localization mechanism, which does not require any dispersion in
contrast to that operating in the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. Based on
this mechanism alone, pairs of fronts in binary-mixture convection are expected
to form {\it stable} pulses if they travel {\it backward}, i.e. opposite to the
phase velocity. For positive velocities the interaction becomes attractive and
destabilizes the pulses. These results are in qualitative agreement with recent
experiments. Since the new mechanism is very robust it is expected to be
relevant in other systems as well in which a wave is coupled to a mean field.
