surveys used to define the local luminosity function (LF), but could it in
principle be detected in deep surveys. To explore the possible contribution of
such objects to faint galaxy counts, we construct catalogs of simulated
non-evolving galaxies drawn from a multivariate distribution of galaxy
luminosities, central surface brightnesses, bulge/disk ratios and
spectral-energy distributions. We compare two models dominated by LSB galaxies
to a standard non-evolving model. Model galaxies are convolved with seeing and
selected in a manner that closely matches real surveys. For each model we
compute the local LF, HI mass function, number counts, redshift and color
distributions. We find it possible to include a large population of LSB
galaxies and incorporate a steep faint-end slope of the LF in our simulations
without violating the constraints on the local LF or HI mass function. For $q_0
= 0.5$, the most favorable model matches the counts to B=23, but falls short of
the observations at fainter magnitudes. The colors and redshift distributions
remain roughly consistent with observations to B=24. The most serious
discrepancy with observations is in the distribution of $r_e$ at faint
magnitudes, suggesting that the model contains too many LSB galaxies.
Nevertheless, the results suggest that LSB galaxies could be a significant
contributor to faint-galaxy counts, reducing the need for such extreme models
of galaxy evolution as rapid merging or bursting dwarf galaxies.

small fraction of 10 $\msun$ black holes. The dynamical friction leads to the

the black holes in a time scale much shorter than that required for a single

depends on the role of three-body binaries formed among the black holes. For a
system with $v\gta 100\kms$ binaries merge by gravitational radiation at some
hardness instead of being ejected. The critical hardness, at which the

of the binary as a heat source. The efficiency is found to be inversely

of cosmological initial conditions: low-density CDM models with and without
cosmological constant, a flat CDM model and a mixed dark matter model. These
models were selected because they span a wide range in cluster formation epoch.
The semi-analytic models that we employ are able to follow both the evolution
of the dark matter component of clusters and the formation and evolution of the
stellar populations of the cluster galaxies. We are thus able to generate model
predictions that can be compared directly with the observational data. In the
low-density CDM models, clusters form at high red- shift and accrete very
little mass at recent times. Our models predict that essentially no evolution
in the observed properties of clusters will have occurred by a redshift of 0.6,
in direct contradiction with the data. In contrast, in the MDM model, both
galaxies and clusters form extremely late. This model predicts evolution which
appears to be too extreme to be in agreement with the observations. The flat
CDM model, which is intermediate in structure formation epoch, is most
successful. This model is able to account for the evolution of the blue
fraction of rich clusters with redshift, the relationship between blue fraction
and cluster richness at different epochs, and the changes in the distribution
of the morphologies of cluster galaxies by a redshift of 0.4.

$SU(3)\times SU(3)$ sigma-model to leading order in a $1/N_f$-expansion, $N_f$
denoting the number of flavours. For realistic meson masses we find a smooth
crossover between $T\sim181.5$ to 192.6~[MeV]. The crossover looks more rapid
in the light quark condensate than in thermodynamic quantities like the energy
and entropy densities. The change in the light quark condensate in this
temperature interval is $\sim$~50\% of the zero-temperature condensate value,
while the entropy density increases by ($5.5\pm0.8)\cdot10^{-3}$~[GeV$^3$].
Since the numerical error is particularly large in this region, we cannot rule
out a finite latent heat smaller than 0.2~[GeV/fm$^3$]. The chiral transition
is washed out for an average pseudoscalar meson octet mass of 203~[MeV]. This
gives an upper bound on the first-order transition region in the meson mass
parameter space. The corresponding ratio of critical to realistic light current
quark masses $m^{crit}_{u,d}/m_{u,d}$ is estimated as $0.26\pm0.08$. This
result is by an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding mean-field
value. Therefore the

expansions and numerical diagonalization. We are mainly interested in results
for general chiral angles but we consider also the superintegrable case. For
the parameter values considered, we find that the band structure of the low-
lying part of the excitation spectrum has the form expected from a
quasiparticle picture with two fundamental particles. Studying the N-dependence
of the spectrum, we confirm the stability of the second fundamental particle in
a limited range of the momentum, even when its energy becomes so high that it
lies very high up among the multiparticle scattering states. This is not a
phenomenon restricted to the superintegrable line. Calculating a
non-translationally invariant correlation function, we give evidence that it is
oscillating. Within our numerical accuracy we find a relation between the
oscillation length and the dip position of the momentum dispersion of the
lightest particle which seems to be quite independent of the chiral angles.

  Contribution to the Electron Mass","21 pages",,,,"hep-th gr-qc nucl-th",,"  It is argued that the nonintegrably singular energy density of the electron's
electromagnetic field (in both the classical point-charge model and quantum
electrodynamics) must entail very strong self-gravitational effects, which, via
black hole phenomena at finite radii, could well cut off the otherwise infinite
electromagnetic contribution to the electron's mass. The general- relativistic
equations for static, spherically symmetric stellar structure are specialized
to treat the self-gravitational effects of static, spheri- cally symmetric,
nonnegative, localized energy densities which may exhibit nonintegrable
singularities at zero radius. It is demonstrated that in many situations,
including the electromagnetic ones of interest here, such a system has a black
hole whose Schwarzschild radius is that where the original energy per radial
distance (the spherical shell area times the original energy density) reaches
the inverse of (2G). The total mass of the system is that of this black hole
(which follows in the usual way from its Schwarz- schild radius) plus the
integrated original energy density outside this black hole. These results
produce, for the classical point-charge model of the electron, an electrostatic
contribution to its mass which is many orders of magnitude larger than its
measured mass. For quantum electrodynamics, how- ever, the result is an
electromagnetic mass contribution which is approxi- mately equal to its bare
mass -- thus about half of its measured mass.
