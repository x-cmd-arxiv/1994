and determined their shapes. For this, three different measures are used. We
use Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the errors in the methods. The
corrected distribution of cluster ellipticities shows a peak at $ \epsilon \sim
0.4 $ and extends to $ \epsilon \sim 0.8 $. The results are self-consistent,
i.e., with the corrected distribution over projected cluster shapes we can
reconstruct the observed distribution and the observed relation between the
number of galaxies in a cluster and its ellipticity. It is shown that the
richer clusters are intrinsically more nearly spherical than the poorer ones.
The corrected distribution of cluster shapes is more consistent with a prolate
population than with an oblate population.
  We compare the corrected true distribution of (projected) ellipticities with
predictions from N-body simulations. For this, we use a catalogue of 75 N-body
simulated clusters (van Kampen 1994) which assume a CDM spectrum with $ \Omega
= 1.0 $. The simulations include a recipe for galaxy formation and merging.
'Observing' these simulated clusters produces an ellipticity distribution that
extends to much higher $ \epsilon $ and that has too few nearly spherical
clusters. Preliminary results of simulations of the formation of clusters in an
$ \Omega = 0.2 $ universe suggest that, on average, clusters are more nearly
spherical in this case.

accurate CCD photometry of three regions in the galaxy, reaching V$\simeq$23.5
with an accuracy of $\sigma_{BVR}\leq$0.1 mag. The comparison of the
observational color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity functions with
corresponding synthetic simulations reveals that the star formation activity in
the last Gyr has been rather continuous, possibly occurring in long episodes
separated by short quiescent periods, and that the initial mass function
exponent $\alpha$ is in the vicinity of Salpeter's value. The studied regions
of NGC~6822 appear to contain different stellar populations. The preferred star
formation regime for Region A is a continuous activity coupled with a
moderately flat $\alpha$. For Region C, instead, our best models suggest a
discontinuous star formation and a moderately steep $\alpha$. NGC 6822 is the
last object of our original sample of five nearby irregulars. We can then draw
the scenario resulting from this sample: most of the observed fields appear to
have experienced a {\it gasping} regime of star formation, with average
exponent $\alpha$=2.35 for the initial mass function. Despite their small
sizes, the majority of the sample galaxies contain different stellar
populations in different regions.

the case where the population is geographically distributed in discrete
locations, and mating only takes place within one location. Keeping the rate of
migration between neighbouring locations at a fixed value, we change the
mutation rate, changing therefore the average overlap between genotypes. When
the overlap between individuals living in different locations falls below a
fecundity threshold, speciation occurs. When more species coexist, the genetic
structure of the population (as described by the overlap distribution $P(q)$)
fluctuates. However, the average overlap, both within one location and among
neighbouring locations, appears to vary according to the same laws as in the
absence of speciation. The model provides a reasonable estimate of the
parameter values necessary to observe geographic speciation, which is found to
be much more likely than the sympatric speciation of the original DH model.
Applications to the case of circular invasion, where the concept of biological
species appears to run into difficulties, are sketched.

automorphism group. We prove the existence of a bi-universal element in the
class of homogeneous families over a given infinite set and give an explicit
construction of $2^\cont$ isomorphism types of homogeneous families over a
countable set.
