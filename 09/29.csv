others apply in one dimension, but need to be modified in higher dimensions.
These latter aspects include the notions that at fixed temperature confining
barriers increase logarithmically with time, that ``components'' are
necessarily bounded regions of state space which depend on the observational
timescale, and that the system continually revisits previously traversed
regions of state space. We examine our results in the context of several

delineating the properties of both Local Group satellite dE's and the large dE
populations of nearby clusters. We review some of these advances, with
particular attention to how well currently available data can constrain 1)
models for the formation of dE's, 2) the physical and evolutionary connections
between different types of galaxies (nucleated and nonnucleated dE's, compact
E's, irregulars, and blue compact dwarfs) that overlap in the same portion of
the mass-spectrum of galaxies, 3) the contribution of dE's to the galaxy
luminosity functions in clusters and the field, 4) the star-forming histories
of dE's and their possible contribution to faint galaxy counts, and 5) the
clustering properties of dE's. In addressing these issues, we highlight the
extent to which selection effects temper these constraints, and outline areas
where new data would be particularly valuable.

produce color-magnitude (CM) diagrams reaching I ~ 22.3 in both fields. After
statistically removing the field-stars from the CM diagram we find that Sgr is
dominated by a moderately old (age ~ 10 Gyr) population, significantly younger
than a typical globular-cluster population. There is some evidence for a weak
intermediate-age component or alternatively a population of blue stragglers.
These results confirm that Sgr is a bona fide dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy,
the ninth found orbiting the Milky Way. We have discovered nine short-period
variables in the Sgr field, well in excess of the number found in the control
field. Seven of these stars have similar apparent magnitudes and are almost
certainly RR~Lyr stars in Sgr. We have used the minimum-light colors of the
RRab variables to determine the reddening of the Sgr field to be E\vi\ = 0.22.
For an assumed RR~Lyr luminosity of M_V = +0.6 we conclude that the distance of
Sgr is 25.2 +/- 2.8 kpc. The properties of the Sgr giant branch and upper main
sequence are consistent with a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.1 +/- 0.3.

on assumptions such as the initial helium abundance and the mass loss rate. A
high helium abundance (e.g., $Y\approx$0.28), as well as an inclusion of helium
diffusion and oxygen-enhancement in stellar models, can lower the current age
estimate for metal-poor globular clusters from 14$\pm 1.5$ Gyr to about 11$\pm

values as high as 60km/sec/Mpc for a universe with the critical density and
90km/sec/Mpc for a baryon-only universe. The uncertainties of a high helium
abundance and an instability strip induced mass loss near the turn-off in
globular clusters are discussed. Ages lower than 10 Gyr are not possible even
with the operation of both of these mechanisms unless the initial helium
abundance in globular clusters is $>0.28$, which can hardly be accomodated by
indirect inferences of helium abundances in globular clusters.

state where perturbations are just able to propagate through the whole system.
For strong damping a regular behavior occurs where a sequence of states
reappears periodically but shifted by an integer multiple of the period of the
external potential. There is a broad transition regime between regular and
irregular behavior, which is characterized by multistability between regular

waves. Shock waves can turn their direction of propagation, or they can split

For higher-dimensional geometries this term has the interesting property
(shared with other dimensionally continued Euler densities) that when the
action is varied with respect to the metric, it gives rise to a symmetric,
covariantly conserved tensor of rank two which is a function of the metric and
its first and second order derivatives. Here we review the unification of
General Relativity and electromagnetism in the classical five-dimen- sional,

modifications of the Einstein-Maxwell theory that results from adding the
Gauss-Bonnet term in the action. The resulting four-dimensional theory
describes a non-linear U(1) gauge theory non-minimally coupled to gravity. For
a point charge at rest, we find a perturbative solution for large distances
which gives a mass-dependent correction to the Coulomb potential. Near the
source we find a power-law solution which seems to cure the short-distance
divergency of the Coulomb potential. Possible ways to obtain an experimen- tal

quantum-chromodynamic potential model which is similar to that used earlier for
the heavy quarkonia. An essential feature of our treatment is the inclusion of
the one-loop radiative corrections to the quark-antiquark potential, which
contribute significantly to the spin-splittings among the quarkonium energy
levels. Unlike $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$, the potential for a light-heavy
system has a complicated dependence on the light and heavy quark masses $m$ and
$M$, and it contains a spin-orbit mixing term. We have obtained excellent
results for the observed energy levels of $D^0$, $D_s$, $B^0$, and $B_s$, and
we are able to provide predicted results for many unobserved energy levels. Our
potential parameters for different quarkonia satisfy the constraints of quantum
chromodynamics.
  We have also used our investigation to test the accuracy of the heavy quark
effective theory. We find that the heavy quark expansion yields generally good
results for the $B^0$ and $B_s$ energy levels provided that $M^{-1}$ and
$M^{-1}\ln M$ corrections are taken into account in the quark-antiquark
interactions. It does not, however, provide equally good results for the energy
levels of $D^0$ and $D_s$, which indicates that the effective theory can be
applied more accurately to the $b$ quark than the $c$ quark.

calculated to order $g^5$ using resummed perturbation theory, but the method

the construction of a sequence of two effective field theories by first
integrating out the momentum scale $T$ and then integrating out the momentum
scale $g T$. The free energy decomposes into the sum of three terms,
corresponding to the momentum scales $T$, $gT$, and $g^2T$. The first term can
be calculated as a perturbation series in $g^2(T)$, where $g(T)$ is the running
coupling constant. The second term in the free energy can be calculated as a
perturbation series in $g(T)$, beginning at order $g^3$. The third term can
also be expressed as a series in $g(T)$ beginning at order $g^6$, with
coefficients that can be calculated using lattice simulations of 3-dimensional
QCD. Leading logarithms of $T/(gT)$ and of $gT/(g^2T)$ can be summed up using

using a recent calculation of the radiative corrections with account for finite
quark masses in nonleptonic decays and taking into account 1/m_b^2 corrections.
For the semileptonic branching ratio we obtain B_SL =(11.8\pm 1.6)% using pole
quark masses and B_SL = (11.0\pm 1.9)% using running MS-bar quark masses. The
uncertainty is dominated by unknown higher order perturbative corrections. We
conclude that the present accuracy of the theoretical analysis does not allow
to state a significant disagreement with the experimental results. However, our
re-analysis of the decay b->ccs yields an increase of (35\pm 11)% due to
next-to-leading order corrections including mass dependent terms, which further
emphasizes the problem of the average charm quark content of the final states
in B decays. Abstract of the erratum: Some of the numerical results presented
in our paper PLB 342 (1995) 362 are affected by an error in the computer
program and need to be revised. The numerical changes are, however, marginal.
We take the opportunity to incorporate the complete results for the quark mass
dependence of the radiative corrections to the subprocess b->ccs and enlarge
the discussion of the average charm quark content in the final state, giving
the results in two different renormalization schemes and adding a figure with
charm quark content plotted vs. the semileptonic branching ratio.
