cubic crystal with nearest--neighbor attractive interactions and weak
next--nearest--neighbor repulsive interactions. It is likely applicable to
alkali halides with the sodium chloride structure. Emphasis is placed on the
fact that the equilibrium crystal shape can be interpreted as a phase diagram
and that the details of its structure tell us into which surface orientations
an unstable surface will decompose. We find that, depending on the temperature
and growth conditions, a number of interesting behaviors are expected. For a
crystal in equilibrium with its vapor, these include a low temperature regime
with logarithmically--slow separation into three symmetrically--equivalent
facets, and a higher temperature regime where separation proceeds as a power
law in time into an entire one--parameter family of surface orientations. For a
crystal slightly out of equilibrium with its vapor (slow crystal growth or
etching), power--law growth should be the rule at late enough times. However,
in the low temperature regime, the rate of separation rapidly decreases as the
chemical potential difference between crystal and vapor phases goes to zero.

Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, the best fit for the combined data
is poor. Furthermore, the data indicate a severe suppression of the $^7$Be flux
relative to the $^8$B, contradicting both standard and nonstandard solar models
in general; the $pp$ flux takes its maximum value allowed by the luminosity
constraint. This pathology consistently appears even if we ignore any one of
the three data. (2) In the presence of the two-flavor MSW effect, the current
constraint on the initial $^8$B flux is weak, but consistent with the SSM and
sufficient to exclude nonstandard models with small $^8$B fluxes. No meaningful
constraint is obtained for the other fluxes. In the future, even allowing MSW,
the $^8$B and $^7$Be fluxes can be determined at the $\pm$(15 -- 20)\% level,
making competing solar models distinguishable. We emphasize that the neutral
current sensitivity for $^7$Be neutrinos in BOREXINO, HELLAZ, and HERON is
essential for determining the initial fluxes. The constraints on the MSW
parameters in the model independent analysis are also discussed.

performance on subsequent trips it might make? This is a type of on-line
problem where a strategy must exploit {\em partial information \/} about the
future (e.g., about obstacles that lie ahead). For scenes with axis-parallel
rectangular obstacles where the Euclidean distance between $s$ and $t$ is $n$,
we present a deterministic algorithm whose {\em average\/} trip length after
