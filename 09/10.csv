packet in a cosine potential perturbed by an external time-dependent force. For
our choice of initial condition and with $\hbar$ small but finite, we find that
the wave packet behaves classically (meaning that the quantum behavior is
indistinguishable from that of the analogous classical system) as long as the
motion is confined to the interior of the remnant separatrix of the cosine
potential. Once the classical motion becomes unbounded, however, we find that
quantum interference effects dominate. This interference leads to a long-lived
accumulation of quantum amplitude on top of the cosine barrier. This pinning of
the amplitude on the barrier is a dynamic mechanism for the quantum inhibition
of classical mixing.

the correlators are shown to be dominated by a power--law behavior even for
finite gluon screening masses. This continuum behavior is well approximated on
current $4\times 16^3$--lattices in the perturbative limit and leads to a
considerable overestimate of screening masses deduced from fitting the lattice
correlators with conventional exponential forms. The use of extended sources
and sinks to enhance the signal improves the situation for screening masses
$m\gg T$ but leads to a largely uncontrolled error for masses less than $T$. In
fact, we show that recent lattice QCD data of Grossmann et al., from which a
magnetic screening mass $m_M \approx 2.9 \, T$ was deduced, may even be
consistent with a vanishing actual magnetic screening mass.
