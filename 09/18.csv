is the most stable 20-atom carbon species, highly accurate calculations
convincingly predict that the smallest fullerene, the dodecahedron C$_{20}$,
has the lowest energy. A related corannulene-like bowl is nearly degenerate in
energy to the fullerene. Thermodynamic considerations suggest that at formation
temperatures of around 700 K the bowl should be the dominant species. The
recent application of gradient corrections to LDA which supported the ring
structure is qualitatively in error. (RK-94-02)

fermion Chern-Simons field theoretical approach. In the absence of impurity
scattering, the essential aspects of fractional quantum Hall effect, such as
the quantization of Hall conductance, as well as quasi-particle charge and
statistics are unrenormalized by thermal fluctuations. On the other hand, we
find that the low energy excitation spectrum at finite $T$ may undergo some
qualitative changes as temperature raises. Possible experimental consequences
are discussed.

a static deviation from the Reissner-Nordstr\o m metric. This is reduced to two
coupled ordinary differential equations for the gravitational and electrostatic
potential functions. The homogeneous equations are explicitly solved in the
particular case $q^2=m^2$, obtaining a multipole expansion with radial
hypergeometric dependence for both potentials. In the limiting case of a
neutral source, the equations are shown to coincide with recent results by
Bondi and Rindler.

the (fully integrable) defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation cannot
describe the dynamics resulting from dissipative perturbations of the
Ginzburg-Landau type. Here spatially slowly decaying changes of the background
wavenumber occur which requires the use of matching technics. It is shown how
the perturbation selects a 1 or 2-parameter subfamily from the 3-parameter
family of dark solitons of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The dynamics of
the perturbed system can then be described analytically as motion within this
selected subfamily yielding interesting scenarios. Interaction with shocks
occurring in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation can be included in a straight
forward way.
