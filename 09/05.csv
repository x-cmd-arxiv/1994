present at nucleosynthesis time. We considered several effects that could be
relevant modifing light elements relic abundances. They include: changes in
reaction rates, mass shifts due to strong and electromagnetic interactions,
variation of the expansion rate of the Universe due to both the magnetic field
energy density and the increasing of the electrons density in overcritical
magnetic fields.
  We find that the latter is the main effect. It was not taken into account in
previous calculations. The allowed field intensity at the end of
nucleosynthesis ($T =1\times 10^9\;^o{\rm K}$) is $B \le 3\times 10^{10}$

  Parameter","32 pages, LaTeX, 10 figures appended (uuencoded postscript files)",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.50.3900",,"cond-mat",,"  The basic Landau model for the incommensurate-commensurate transition to the
uniform or dimerized uniaxial ordering is critically reexamined. The previous
analyses identified only sinusoidal and homogeneous solutions as
thermodynamically stable and proposed a simple phase diagram with the first
order phase transition between these configurations. By performing the
numerical analysis of the free energy and the Euler-Lagrange equation we show
that the phase diagram is more complex. It also contains a set of metastable
solutions present in the range of coexistence of homogeneous and sinusoidal
solutions. These new configurations are periodic patterns of homogeneous
domains connected by sinusoidal segments. They are Lyapunov unstable, very
probably due to the nonintegrability of the free energy functional. We also
discuss some other mathematical aspects of the model, and compare it with the
essentially simpler sine-Gordon model for the transitions to the states with
higher commensurabilities. The present results might be a basis for the
explanation of phenomena like thermal hystereses, cascades of phase
transitions, and memory effects, observed in materials exhibiting the
transitions to uniform or dimerized state.
  Some particular examples are discussed in detail.

supergravity extension of the Standard Model. This model has the usual
five-dimensional parameter space plus an additional parameter $\xi_{3/2}\equiv

the whole parameter space. A necessary condition for the potential to be stable
is ${\rm Str}{\cal M}^4>0$, which is satisfied if $\bf m_{3/2}\lsim2 m_{\tilde

interesting and potentially observable new phenomena in the neutral scalar
sector of the theory which would constitute a ``smoking gun'' of the no-scale
mechanism. This new phenomenology is model-independent and divides into three
scenarios, depending on the ratio of the weak scale to the vev at the minimum
of the no-scale direction. We also calculate the residual vacuum energy at the
unification scale ($C_0\, m^4_{3/2}$), and find that in typical models one must
require $C_0>10$. Such constraints should be important in the search for the
correct string no-scale supergravity model. We also show how specific classes

done by keeping a finite world sheet cutoff. We construct one example of an
off-shell covariant Klein Gordon type interaction. For a suitable choice of the
gauge transformation of the scalar field, gauge invariance is maintained off
mass shell. However at second order in the gauge field interaction, one finds
that (U(1)) gauge invariance is violated due to the finite cutoff.
Interestingly, we find, to lowest order, that by adding a massive mode with
appropriate gauge transformation laws to the sigma model background, one can
restore gauge invariance. The gauge transformation law is found to be
consistent, to the order calculated, with what one expects from the interacting
equation of motion of the massive field. We also extend some previous
discussion on applying the proper time formalism for propagating gauge
particles, to the interacting (i.e. Yang Mills) case.
