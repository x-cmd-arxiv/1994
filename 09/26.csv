derived under the LTE assumption have significant systematic errors, especially
for metal-poor stars. For beryllium, current results suggest that departures

to introduce new symmetries and particles. To test this idea, a lattice
simulation is performed. The problem is investigated in the CP$^3$ model first.
It is found that the model has a first order phase transition in $\theta$ from
a confining phase at small $\theta$ to a deconfining phase at large $\theta$,
and that the critical value of $\theta$ decreases towards zero as $\beta$ is
taken to infinity. This suggests that $\theta$ is tuned to zero in the
continuum limit. Preliminary studies of the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in four
dimensions show a phase transition in $\theta$ as well, so that it is quite
likely that the strong CP problem in QCD is solved along the same line.

the heavy-flavor-symmetry approach for heavy-light form factors provided that
the form factor $F_0$ behaves as a constant, while the $q^2$ dependence is of
the monopole form for $F_1,~ A_0,~A_1$, and of the dipole behavior for $A_2$
and $V$. This $q^2$ extrapolation for form factors is further supported by
$B\to K^*\gamma$ data and by a recent QCD-sum-rule analysis. We then apply this
method to $B\to D(D^*)\pi(\rho)$ decays to extract the parameters $a_1$ and
$a_2$. It is found that $a_1(B\to D^{(*)}\pi(\rho))=1.01\pm 0.06$ and $a_2(B\to
