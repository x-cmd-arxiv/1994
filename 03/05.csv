  Observations of M33","16 pages + 9 figures, uuencoded compressed postscript file",,"10.1086/174556",,"astro-ph",,"  We have obtained 12CO and 13CO J=1-0 observations of the nearby spiral galaxy
M33 to try to resolve the long-standing discrepancy between 12CO/13CO line
ratios measured in Galactic giant molecular clouds and external galaxies.
Interferometer maps of the molecular cloud MC20 give a 12CO/13CO line ratio of
7.5+/-2.1, which agrees reasonably well with the line ratio measured in
Galactic giant molecular clouds. In contrast, the 12CO/13CO line ratio obtained
from single dish data is 10.0+/-0.9, significantly higher than Galactic values
but in good agreement with line ratios measured in other galaxies. The
interferometer map of MC20 reveals that the cloud has similar spatial and
velocity extents in the two lines, and thus the high single dish line ratio
cannot be due to different filling factors in the two lines. In addition, the
single dish data show no evidence for significant variations in the line ratio
with metallicity, which eliminates abundance changes as the explanation for the
high single dish line ratio. We conclude that the high 12CO/13CO line ratio s
observed in M33, and in the disks of spiral galaxies in general, are due to the
presence of a population of diffuse molecular clouds. The lower limit to the
fraction of the total 12CO emission from M33 that originates in the diffuse
clouds is 30+/-30%, while the upper limit is ~60%.

the 2D Yukawa models belong to the universality class of the Gross-Neveu models
not only at weak scalar field self-coupling but also for a broad range of the
bare parameters which is not accessible to the $1/N_F$ expansion. New

Gauge-invariant operators have `alien' gauge-variant operators among their

have only themselves as counterterms. Moreover, the alien operators are
supposed to vanish in physical matrix elements. A recent calculation by Hamberg
and van Neerven apparently contradicts these results. By explicit calculations
with the energy-momentum tensor, we show that the problems arise because of
subtle infra-red singularities that appear when gluonic matrix elements are
