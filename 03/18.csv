  Submitted to ApJ. Replaced with single spaced version with corrected line
  lengths and necessary macro",,"10.1086/175804",,"astro-ph",,"  We trace the evolution of cosmic microwave background photons propagating
through a reionized model universe. The reionization of the intergalactic
medium is achieved by UV photons emitted from the decaying `hot' dark matter
neutrinos. The model universe is represented by a comoving cube through which
we propagate photons and subject them to the Sachs-Wolfe effect and Thomson
scattering off the ionized fraction of the IGM, beginning at z=1900 until the
present z=0. The simulation follows the evolving matter inhomogeneities and
microwave background photons into the present nonlinear regime and yields
temperature maps of the microwave sky as a comoving observer would detect. Our
temperature maps display anisotropies on scales ranging from 2 to 8 degrees
with rms amplitudes ranging from DT/T_{rms} =2.8 to 3.4 times 10^{-5} without
reionization. If we allow the neutrinos to decay and subsequently reionize the
IGM, the level of the temperature anisotropies is reduced to DT/T=0.8 to 1.1
times 10^{-5}. This includes the Doppler shifts suffered by the CMB photons as
they scatter off the moving ionized fraction of the IGM. If, however,
reionization is caused by a late and sudden energy input into the IGM, we find
that some reduction in $\Delta T/T$ occurs, but not enough to make this
scenario consistent with observations. We find that the decaying neutrino
hypothesis is more efficient at reducing primordial anisotropies and generates
smaller Doppler anisotropies than a model reionized via a late and sudden
energy input into the IGM.

The transition functions between asymptotic solutions to the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation are described. A connection between asymptotic
solutions and the crystal base in the tensor product of modules over the
quantum group $U_qs\ell_2$ is established, in particular, a correspondence
between the Bethe vectors of the Gaudin model of an inhomogenious magnetic
chain and the $\Bbb Q-$basis of the crystal base.

the BRST invariant Lagrangian is used and the same spin factor is obtained as

series is studied. When the model allows tunneling, the path-integral
functional in the zero instanton sector is known to be dominated by bounce-like
configurations at large order of the perturbative series, which causes
non-convergence of the series. We find that in addition to this bounce the
perturbative functional has a subleading peak at the instanton and
anti-instanton pair, and its sum reproduces the non-perturbative valley.

some coarse graining procedure over a microscopic model. Here we consider some
special problems that arise when the microscopic model is taken to be
relativistic quantum field theory. These problems are associated with the
existence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume. Because
of these the microscopic entropy can, and typically does, diverge for sharply
localized states. However the difference in the entropy between two such states
is better behaved, and for most purposes it is the useful quantity to consider.
In particular, a renormalized entropy can be defined as the entropy relative to
the ground state. We make these remarks quantitative and precise in a simple
model situation: the states of a conformal quantum field theory excited by a
moving mirror. From this work, we attempt to draw some lessons concerning the
``information problem'' in black hole physics
