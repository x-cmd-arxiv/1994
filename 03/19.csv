  Automata, American Mathematical Society, 1994",,,,"comp-gas nlin.CG",,"  Introduced is a lattice-gas with long-range 2-body interactions. An effective
inter-particle force is mediated by momentum exchanges. There exists the
possibility of having both attractive and repulsive interactions using finite
impact parameter collisions. There also exists an interesting possibility of
coupling these long-range interactions to a heat bath. A fixed temperature heat
bath induces a permanent net attractive interparticle potential, but at the
expense of reversibility. Thus the long-range dynamics is a kind of a Monte
Carlo Kawasaki updating scheme. The model has a $P\rho T$ equation of state.
Presented are analytical and numerical results for the a lattice-gas fluid
governed by a nonideal equation of state. The model's complexity is not much
beyond that of the FHP lattice-gas. It is suitable for massively parallel
processing and may be used to study critical phenomena in large systems.

low-energy limit, when defined in a covariant way, should be related to
background fields with covariantly constant curvature, gauge field strength and
potential. Some new approaches for calculating the low-energy heat kernel
assuming a covariantly constant background are proposed. The one-loop
low-energy effective action in Yang-Mills theory in flat space with arbitrary
compact simple gauge group and arbitrary matter on a covariantly constant

representations of a semi-simple Lie group with the symplectic geometry of some
of its homogeneous spaces. In the first part of the present work this point of
view is extended to the supersymmetric context, through the study of the
OSp(2/2) coherent states. These are explicitly constructed starting from the
known abstract typical and atypical representations of osp(2/2). Their
underlying geometries turn out to be those of supersymplectic OSp(2/2)
homogeneous spaces. Moment maps identifying the latter with coadjoint orbits of
OSp(2/2) are exhibited via Berezin's symbols. When considered within
Rothstein's general paradigm, these results lead to a natural general
definition of a super K\""ahler supermanifold, the supergeometry of which is
determined in terms of the usual geometry of holomorphic Hermitian vector
bundles over K\""ahler manifolds. In particular, the supergeometry of the above
orbits is interpreted in terms of the geometry of Einstein-Hermitian vector
bundles. In the second part, an extension of the full geometric quantization
procedure is applied to the same coadjoint orbits. Thanks to the super K\""ahler
character of the latter, this procedure leads to explicit super unitary
irreducible representations of OSp(2/2) in super Hilbert spaces of $L^2$
superholomorphic sections of prequantum bundles of the Kostant type. This work
lays the foundations of a program aimed at classifying Lie supergroups'
coadjoint orbits and their associated irreducible representations, ultimately
leading to harmonic superanalysis. For this purpose a set of consistent
conventions is exhibited.
