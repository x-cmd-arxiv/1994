$^4$He, and $^7$Li only agree with their inferred primordial abundances if the
fraction of critical density contributed by baryons is between $0.01h^{-2}$ and
$0.02h^{-2}$ ($h$ is the present value of the Hubble constant in units of
$100\kms\Mpc^{-1}$). This is the basis of the very convincing and important
argument that baryons can contribute at most 10\% of critical density and thus
cannot close the Universe. Nonstandard scenarios involving decaying
particles,$^1$ inhomogeneities in the baryon density,$^2$ and even more exotic
ideas$^3$ put forth to evade this bound have been largely unsuccessful.$^4$ We
suggest a new way of relaxing the bound: If the tau neutrino has a mass of
$20\MeV-30\MeV$ and lifetime of $200\sec -1000\sec$, and its decay products
include electron neutrinos, the bound to the baryon mass density can be
loosened by a about factor of $10$. The key is the decay-generated electron
antineutrinos: around the time of nucleosynthesis they are captured by protons
to produce neutrons, thereby changing the outcome of nucleosynthesis.
Experiments at $e^\pm$ colliders should soon be sensitive to a tau-neutrino
mass in the required range.

  MPA 796",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We announce the detection of correlations on angular scales of $\ga10'$
between optically bright, high-redshift, radio-loud QSOs with diffuse X-ray
emission seen by ROSAT in the {\it All-Sky Survey}. These correlations reach
significance levels of up to $99.8\%$. A comparison of the results with a
sample of control fields, bootstrapping analyses, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
provide unambiguous support for the statistical significance of the
correlations found. We argue that the detected enhanced diffuse X-ray emission
is in the foreground of the QSOs, and that it is probably due to galaxy
clusters which magnify the QSOs by their gravitational lensing effect, thereby
giving rise to a magnification bias in the background source sample. A
comparison of the results presented below with correlations previously found
between the same QSO sample and either Lick or IRAS galaxies provides further
evidence for this interpretation, and identifies positions in the sky where
weak gravitational lensing may be detected by searching for coherent
distortions of background galaxy images.

superposed isolated weak matter inhomogeneities. In a series of well-defined
approximations, the equations of gravitational lens theory are derived.
Finally, we derive a relative optical focusing equation which describes the
focusing of light beams relative to the case that the beam is unaffected by
matter inhomogeneities in the universe, from which it follows immediately that
no beam can be focused less than one which is unaffected by matter clumps,
before it propagates through its first conjugate point.

the loop-flip and loop-exchange algorithms. For these two algorithms and the
standard worldline algorithm, we calculated the autocorrelation times for
various physical quantities and found that the ordinary worldline algorithm,
which uses only local moves, suffers from very long correlation times that
makes not only the estimate of the error difficult but also the estimate of the
average values themselves difficult. These difficulties are especially severe
in the low-temperature, large-$U$ regime. In contrast, we find that new
algorithms, when used alone or in combinations with themselves and the standard
algorithm, can have significantly smaller autocorrelation times, in some cases
being smaller by three orders of magnitude. The new algorithms, which use
non-local moves, are discussed from the point of view of a general prescription
for developing cluster algorithms. The loop-flip algorithm is also shown to be
ergodic and to belong to the grand canonical ensemble. Extensions to other
models and higher dimensions is briefly discussed.
