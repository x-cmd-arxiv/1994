to the generalized Penner model. The solution is presented in a form which
allows us in a very straightforward manner to localize critical points and to
investigate the scaling behaviour of the model in the vicinity of these points.
We carry out an analysis of the critical behaviour to all genera addressing all
types of multi-critical points. In certain regions of the coupling constant
space the model must be defined via analytical continuation. We show in detail
how this works for the Penner model. Using analytical continuation it is
possible to reach the fermionic 1-matrix model. We show that the critical
points of the fermionic 1-matrix model can be indexed by an integer, $m$, as it
was the case for the ordinary hermitian 1-matrix model. Furthermore the $m$'th
multi-critical fermionic model has to all genera the same value of
$\gamma_{str}$ as the $m$'th multi-critical hermitian model. However, the
coefficients of the topological expansion need not be the same in the two
cases. We show explicitly how it is possible with a fermionic matrix model to
reach a $m=2$ multi-critical point for which the topological expansion has
alternating signs, but otherwise coincides with the usual Painlev\'{e}
expansion.

Defining the simplest vacuum, the Dirac sea, we evaluate the central extension
for this algebra. A new algebra which contains the central extension is called
the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show that this $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra is an
origin of the Kac-Moody algebra which determines the behavior of edge states of
the system. We discuss the relation between the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra and the
incompressibility of the integer quantum Hall system.

to include chiral operators with fractional quantum group spins (fourth or
sixth of integers) which are needed to achieve modular invariance. We extend
the study of the chiral bootstrap (recently completed by E. Cremmer, and the
present authors) to the case of semi-infinite quantum-group representations
which correspond to positive integral screening numbers. In particular, we
prove the Bidenharn-Elliot and Racah identities for q-deformed 6-j symbols
generalized to continuous spins. The decoupling of the family of physical
chiral operators (with real conformal weights) at the special values
C_{Liouville}= =7, 13, and 19, is shown to provide a full solution of Moore and
Seiberg's equations, only involving operators with real conformal weights.
Moreover, our study confirms the existence of the strongly coupled topological
models. The three-point functions are shown to be given by a product of leg
factors similar to the ones of the weakly coupled models. However, contrary to
this latter case, the equality between the quantum group spins of the
holomorphic and antiholomorphic components is not preserved by the local vertex
operator. Thus the ``c=1'' barrier appears as connected with a deconfinement of
chirality.

Previously the FBA was only known for $SL(2)$ and $SL(3)$ (and associated)
$R$-matrices. In this paper I advance Sklyanin's program by giving the FBA for
certain systems with $SL(N)$ $R$-matrices. This is achieved by constructing
rational functions $\A(u)$ and $\B(u)$ of the matrix elements of $T(u)$, so
that, in the generic case, the zeros $x_i$ of $\B(u)$ are the separation
coordinates and the $P_i=\A(x_i)$ provide their conjugate momenta. The method
is illustrated with the magnetic chain and the Gaudin model, and its wider
applicability is discussed.

is made with the incompressibility derived from the semi-infinite nuclear

Investigating the dependence of the breathing-mode energy on the nuclear matter
incompressibility, it is shown that dynamical properties of surface respond
differently in the RMF theory than in the Skyrme approach.
