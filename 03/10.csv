turn, are compared with available results of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)

results shows a very reasonable agreement that seems to be progressively
improvable. This provides encouragement for the application of the OTF model to
condensed phase systems. The QMC calculations of the density do not agree well
with the density functional results. The reasons for this poor agreement are
not clear. This particular system is expected to be an ideal one for

capture of the spherically symmetric mode of a charged, massive test field on
the background spacetime of a black hole with charge $Q$ and mass $M$. The
spacetime geometry near the horizon of a $|Q|=M$ black hole has a scaling
symmetry, which is absent if $|Q|<M$, a scale being introduced by the surface
gravity. We show that this symmetry leads to the existence of a self-similiar
solution for the charged field near the horizon, and further, that there is a
one parameter family of discretely self-similiar solutions . The scaling
symmetry, or lack thereof, also shows up in correlation length scales, defined
in terms of the rate at which the influence of an external source coupled to
the field dies off. It is shown by constructing the Greens functions, that an
external source has a long range influence on the extremal background, compared
to a correlation length scale which falls off exponentially fast in the $|Q|<M$
case. Finally it is shown that in the limit of $\Delta \equiv (1-{Q^2 \overM^2}

changes in the black hole area vary like $\Delta ^{1\over 2}$.

part by quantum effects close to their maximum size. Because of the resulting

expansion of the universe and black holes can be observed). It is conjectured
that the quantum universe remains completely singularity-free in this way

moduli spaces of string vacua. These include (1) finiteness of the volume of
the moduli space and (2) chaotic motion of the moduli in the early universe. To
fix ideas we examine in detail the example of the (conjectural) dilaton-axion
``$S$-duality'' of four-dimensional string compactifications. The facts (1) and
(2) together might help to solve some problems with the standard scenarios for
supersymmetry breaking and vacuum selection in string theory.

coproduct operation for representations of the Hopf algebra of functions on the

$\Pi$ is introdused. This means that the representation $\Pi$ is invariant
under coproduct by arbitrary representation. Algebra of functions on the
quantum group $SU_{q}(2)$ in the representation $\Pi$ is a factor of a type
II$_{\infty}$. Formula for the trace in the representation $\Pi$ is given . The

related branches: one can be connected smoothly to an expanding

properties, the two branches can evolve smoothly into each other. We find,
however, that just the effects of a potential do not allow for a graceful exit
from accelerated inflation in the weak curvature regime. We explain how
conformal field theory techniques could be used to give a decisive answer on
whether graceful exit from accelerated inflation is possible at all.

tree ${}^{<\omega}\omega$ (ordered by inclusion) forms an almost disjoint
family (of sets of nodes). This family is not maximal -- for example, any level
of the tree is almost disjoint from all of the branches. How many sets must be
added to the family of branches to make it maximal? This question leads to a
series of definitions and results: a set of nodes is {\it off-branch} if it is
almost disjoint from every branch in the tree; an {\it off-branch family} is an
almost disjoint family of off-branch sets; ${\frak o}=\min\{|{\Cal O}|: {\Cal
O}$ is a maximal off-branch family$\}$. Results concerning $\frak o$ include:
(in ZFC) ${\frak a}\leq{\frak o}$, and (consistent with ZFC) $\frak o$ is not
equal to any of the standard small cardinal invariants $\frak b$, $\frak a$,
$\frak d$, or ${\frak c}=2^\omega$. Most of these consistency results use
standard forcing notions -- for example, $Con({\frak b}={\frak a}<{\frak
o}={\frak d}={\frak c})$ comes from starting with a model of $ZFC+CH$ and
adding $\omega_2$-many Cohen reals. Many interesting open questions remain,
though -- for example, $Con({\frak o}<{\frak d})$.

close to the critical value, concerning the formation of a quark-gluon-plasma.
This indicates the importance of fluctuations and the necessity to go beyond
the investigation of average events. Therefore, we introduce a percolation
approach to model the final stage ($\tau > 1$ fm/c) of ion-ion collisions, the
initial stage being treated by well-established methods, based on strings and
Pomerons. The percolation approach amounts to finding high density domains, and
treating them as quark-matter droplets. In this way, we have a {\bf realistic,
microscopic, and Monte--Carlo based model which allows for the formation of
quark matter.} We find that even at SPS energies large quark-matter droplets
are formed -- at a low rate though. In other words: large quark-matter droplets
are formed due to geometrical fluctuation, but not in the average event.
