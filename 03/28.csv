  significanly revised and expanded version of the original paper. Several
  significant typos in the section on heights have been corrected and four new
  sections have been added. Among the new results are proofs of several
  generalizations of the classical Franchetta Conjecture to curves with a level
  structure and n marked points. Another section contains a computation of the
  monodromy group of nth roots of the canonical bundle. The two",,,,"alg-geom math.AG",,"  In this paper we give an exposition of Dennis Johnson's work on the first
homology of the Torelli groups and show how it can be applied, alone and in
concert with Saito's theory of Hodge modules, to study the geometry of moduli
spaces of curves. For example, we show that the picard groups of moduli spaces
of curves with a fixed level structure are finitely generated, classify all
""natural"" normal functions defined over moduli spaces of curves with a fixed
level, and also ""compute"" the height paring between cycles over moduli spaces
of curves which are homologically trivial and disjoint over the generic point.
Several new sections have been added. These apply the results on normal
functions to prove generalizations of the classical Franchetta conjecture for
curves and abelian varieties. In one section, the monodromy group of nth roots
of the canonical bundle is computed.

10 galaxies that have yielded detectable microwave molecular--line transitions.
These include several which show OH megamaser or superluminous \water\/ maser
emission. Within the Galaxy, \methanol\/ and OH masers often occur in the same
star formation regions and, in most cases, the \methanol\/ masers have a
greater peak flux density than their OH counterparts. Thus we might expect
\methanol\/ masers to be associated with extragalactic OH maser sources. We
failed to detect any emission or absorption above our 60--mJy detection limit.
We conclude that if the physical conditions exist to produce \methanol\/
megamaser emission, they are incompatible with the conditions which produce OH
megamaser emission.

of four possible microlensing events by monitoring, over several months, the
brightness of millions of stars in the region of the galactic bulge. If these
events are due to microlensing, the most accurate way to get information on the
mass of the dark compact objects, that acted as gravitational lenses, is to use
the method of the mass moments. Here I apply this method to the analysis of the
events detected by OGLE. The average mass turns out to be 0.28$M_{\odot}$,
suggesting that the lens objects are faint disk stars. The same method applied
to the five microlensing events detected so far by the EROS and MACHO
collaborations, which monitor stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, leads to an
average value of 0.08$M_{\odot}$ for the dark compact halo objects.

undergo quantum tunneling. The two examples considered are a moving mirror in
flat space which tunnels through a potential barrier, and a false vacuum bubble
which tunnels to form a black hole. WKB approximations to the Schrodinger and
Wheeler-DeWitt equations are made, leading one to solve field equations on the
Euclidean metric solution interpolating between the classically allowed
geometries. The state of the field after tunneling can then be determined using
the method of non-unitary Bogolubov transformations developed by Rubakov. It is
shown that the effect of the tunneling is to damp any excitations initially
present, and, in the case of the black hole, that the behaviour of fields on
the Euclidean Kruskal manifold ensures that the late time radiation will be
thermal at the Hawking temperature.

without assuming the timelike convergence condition. The assumptions made in
the proof are ones likely to hold both in open universes and in many closed
ones. (It is further argued that at least some of the expanding closed
universes that do not obey a key assumption of the theorem will have initial
singularities on other grounds.) The result is significant for two reasons:
(a)~previous closed-universe singularity theorems have assumed the timelike
convergence condition, and (b)~the timelike convergence condition is known to
be violated in inflationary spacetimes. An immediate consequence of this
theorem is that a recent result on initial singularities in open,
future-eternal, inflating spacetimes may now be extended to include many closed
universes. Also, as a fringe benefit, the time-reverse of the theorem may be
applied to gravitational collapse.

Newtonian cosmology with a perfect fluid matter model and a positive
cosmological constant. It is shown that if the initial data for an expanding
cosmological model of this type is subjected to a small perturbation then the
corresponding solution exists globally in the future and the perturbation
decays in a way which can be described precisely. It is emphasized that no
linearization of the equations or special symmetry assumptions are needed. The
result can also be interpreted as a proof of the nonlinear stability of the
homogeneous models. In order to prove the theorem we write the general solution
as the sum of a homogeneous background and a perturbation. As a by-product of
the analysis it is found that there is an invariant sense in which an
inhomogeneous model can be regarded as a perturbation of a unique homogeneous
model. A method is given for associating uniquely to each Newtonian
cosmological model with compact spatial sections a spatially homogeneous model
which incorporates its large-scale dynamics. This procedure appears very
natural in the Newton-Cartan theory which we take as the starting point for
Newtonian cosmology.

heavy-to-light processes, we show that the form factor of the $B \rar K^* \

where the errors come respectively from the procedure in the sum rule analysis,
the errors in the input and in the $SU(3)_f$-breaking parameters. This result
leads to $Br(B\rar K^* \ \gamma) \simeq (4.45 \pm 1.12) \times 10^{-5}$ in
agreement with the recent CLEO data. Parametrization of the $M_b$-dependence of
the form factor including the $SU(3)_f$-breaking effects is given in (26),
