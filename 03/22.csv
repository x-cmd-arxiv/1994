been calculated in order to determine the primordial $^7$Li abundance and to
test current stellar evolution models by a comparison to the extensive database
of Li abundances in extremely metal poor halo stars observed by Thorburn
(1994). Standard models do a good job of fitting the observed Li abundances in
stars hotter than 5600 K. They predict a primordial $^7$Li abundance of Log
N(Li) = 2.24\pm 0.03$. Models which include microscopic diffusion predict a
downward curvature in the $^7$Li destruction isochrones at hot temperatures
which is not present in the observations. Thus, the observations clearly rule
out models which include uninhibited microscopic diffusion of $^7$Li from the
surface of the star. The [Fe/H] = -2.3 stellar models which include both
diffusion and rotational mixing provide an excellent match to the observations.
Both the plateau stars and the heavily depleted cool stars are well fit by
these models. The rotational mixing leads to considerable $^7$Li depletion in
these models and the primordial $^7$Li abundance inferred from these models is
Log N(Li) = $3.08\pm 0.1$.

voids in the Universe. Our simulations -- carried out using 128$^3$ particles
in a cubical box with side 128 Mpc -- indicate that the void spectrum evolves
with time and that the mean void size in the standard COBE-normalised Cold Dark
Matter (hereafter CDM) model with $h_{50} = 1,$ scales approximately as $\bar
D(z) = {\bar D_0\over \sqrt {1+z}},$ where $\bar D_0 \simeq 10.5$ Mpc.
Interestingly, we find a strong correlation between the sizes of voids and the
value of the primordial gravitational potential at void centers. This
observation could in principle, pave the way towards reconstructing the form of
the primordial potential from a knowledge of the observed void spectrum.
Studying the void spectrum at different cosmological epochs, for spectra with a
built in $k$-space cutoff we find that, the number of voids in a representative
volume evolves with time. The mean number of voids first increases until a
maximum value is reached (indicating that the formation of cellular structure
is complete), and then begins to decrease as clumps and filaments merge leading
to hierarchical clustering and the subsequent elimination of small voids. The
cosmological epoch characterizing the completion of cellular structure occurs
when the length scale going nonlinear approaches the mean distance between
peaks of the gravitational potential. A central result of this paper is that

relating it to the difference in particle creation in different histories. We
then apply this to the case of a free quantum scalar field in a spatially flat

for the scale factor for these semiclassical cosmologies. This approach based
on statistical field theory extends the conventional theory of semiclassical
gravity based on a semiclassical Einstein equation with a source given by the
average value of the energy momentum tensor, thus making it possible to probe
into the statistical properties of quantum fields like noise, fluctuations,
entropy, decoherence and dissipation. Recognition of the stochastic nature of
semiclassical gravity is an essential step towards the investigation of the
behavior of fluctuations, instability and phase transition processes associated
with the crossover to quantum gravity.

the (symmetric) quark and lepton mass matrices follows if one extends the gauge
group of the standard model to include an horizontal $U(1)$ gauge factor,
constrained by the need for anomaly cancellation. This $U(1)$ symmetry is
spontaneously broken slightly below the unification/string scale leaving as its

is possible only in the context of superstring theories via the Green Schwarz

two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We discuss the bosonization of this theory,
which for YM_2 gave a precise interpretation of Wilson loop operators in terms
of string creation and annihilation operators, and examine its consequences for
a string interpretation here. The formalism seems entirely adequate for the
leading large N results and in a sense can be thought of as a `classical string
field theory'. In considering subleading orders in 1/N, we identify some major
differences between CSW and YM_2, which must be dealt with to find a CSW gauge

certain rationality constraint, so there is an infinite, discrete set of
possible coupling matrices. For one particular choice of the coupling matrix,
this model reproduces the low-energy dynamics of fermions scattering from a
magnetic monopole. A quick survey of the Green's functions shows that the
S-matrix is nonunitary. This nonunitarity is present in previous results for
the monopole-fermion system, although it appears not to have been noted. We
indicate how unitarity may be restored by expanding the Fock space to include
