cosmological perturbations of an irrotational collisionless fluid is
considered. Solutions are given at second order in perturbation theory for the
relevant fluid and geometric quantities and compared with the corresponding
ones in the Newtonian approximation. Specifically, we compute the density, the
volume expansion scalar, the shear, the ``electric"" part, or tide, and the
``magnetic"" part of the Weyl tensor. The evolution of the shear and the tide
beyond the linear regime strongly depends on the ratio of the characteristic
size of the perturbation to the cosmological horizon distance. For
perturbations on sub--horizon scales the usual Newtonian approximation applies,
at least at the considered perturbative order; on super--horizon scales,
instead, a new picture emerges, which we call ``silent universe"", as each fluid
element evolves independently of the environment, being unable to exchange
signals with the surrounding matter through either sound waves or gravitational
radiation. For perturbations inside the Hubble radius particular attention is
paid in singling out non--local effects during the non--linear evolution of
fluid elements. These non--local effects are shown to be carried by a traceless
and divergenceless tensor, contained in the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor,
which is dynamically generated as soon as the system evolves away from the
linear regime.

theory always can be globally defined in a covariant manner. Associated with
any infinitesimal diffeomorphism is a Noether current $(n-1)$-form, $\bJ$, and
corresponding Noether charge $(n-2)$-form, $\bQ$. We derive a general
``decomposition formula"" for $\bQ$. Using this formula for the Noether charge,
we prove that the first law of black hole mechanics holds for arbitrary
perturbations of a stationary black hole. (For higher derivative theories,
previous arguments had established this law only for stationary perturbations.)
Finally, we propose a local, geometrical prescription for the entropy,
$S_{dyn}$, of a dynamical black hole. This prescription agrees with the Noether
charge formula for stationary black holes and their perturbations, and is
independent of all ambiguities associated with the choices of $\bL$, $\th$, and
$\bQ$. However, the issue of whether this dynamical entropy in general obeys a

quantum field theory. The general principles relating statistical mechanics and
the path integral formulation of quantum field theory are presented in the
first lecture. These principles are then illustrated in lecture 2 by a
presentation of the theory of the Ising model for $H=0$, where both the
homogeneous and randomly inhomogeneous models are treated and the scaling
theory and the relation with Fredholm determinants and Painlev{\'e} equations
is presented. In lecture 3 we consider the Ising model with $H\neq 0$, where
the relation with gauge theory is used to discuss the phenomenon of
confinement. We conclude in the last lecture with a discussion of quantum spin
diffusion in one dimensional chains and a presentation of the chiral Potts
model which illustrates the physical effects that can occur when the Euclidean
and Minkowski regions are not connected by an analytic continuation. (To be

string theory based on a linearized $W_N$\ algebra. The $w_N$\ string theory is
obtained as a special realization of the $w_{N+1}$\ string. The $w_{\infty}$\
string theory is a universal string theory in this sense. We have also shown
that there is a similar sequence for $N=1$\ string theory. The $N=1\ w_N$\
string can be given as a special case of the $N=1\ w_{N+1}$\ string. In
addition, we show that the $w_3$\ string theory is obtained as a special
realization of the $N=1\ w_3$\ string. We conjecture that the $w_N$\ string can
be obtained as a special $N=1\ w_N$\ string for general $w_N$. If this is the
case, $N=1\ w_{\infty}$\ string theory is more universal since it includes both
$N=0$\ and $N=1$\ $w_N$\ string theories.

the concept of complementary representations, we examine $Z_2$-orbifold
constructions in general, and propose a technique for identifying the orbifold
theory without knowledge of its explicit construction. This technique is then
generalised to twists of order 3, 5 and 7, and we proceed to apply our
considerations to the FKS constructions $H(\Lambda)$ ($\Lambda$ an even
self-dual lattice) and the reflection-twisted orbifold theories $\widetilde
H(\Lambda)$, which together remain the only $c=24$ theories which have so far
been proven to exist. We also make, in the course of our arguments, some
comments on the automorphism groups of the theories $H(\Lambda)$ and
$\widetilde H(\Lambda)$, and of meromorphic theories in general, introducing
the concept of deterministic theories.
