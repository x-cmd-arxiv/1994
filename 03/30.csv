on assumptions like the initial helium abundance and the mass loss rate. A high
helium abundance (e.g., $Y\approx$0.28) or a mass loss rate of
$\sim$10$^{-11}M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ near the main sequence turn-off region lowers
the current age estimate from 14 Gyr to about 10--12 Gyr, significantly
relaxing the constraints on the Hubble constant, allowing values as high as
60km/sec/Mpc for a universe with the critical density and 90km/sec/Mpc for a
baryon-only universe. Possible mechanisms for the helium enhancement in
globular clusters are discussed, as are arguments for an instability strip
induced mass loss near the turn-off. Ages lower than 10 Gyr are not possible
even with the operation of both of these mechanisms unless the initial helium
abundance in globular clusters is $>0.30$, which would conflict with indirect
measurements of helium abundances in globular clusters.

two interacting quantum fields, deriving the influence action via a

how noise of quantum fields can be defined and derive a general fluctuation-

$B\wedge F$ theory to give a Bogomol'nyi structure. A class of non-singular,
finite-Action, stable solutions to the variational field equations is

Yang-Mills theory. The solutions to the Bogomol'nyi equations in the
topologically least complicated $U(1)$ theory have a well-behaved (covariant)
phase space of dimension four---the same as that for photons. The dimensional
reduction of the four-dimensional Lagrangian is also examined. Bogomol'nyi
$U(2)$ solitons resembling the intermediate vector bosons $Z_o$, $W^\pm$ are

below half-filling the low energy effective dynamics of the spin and charge
degrees of freedom is represented in the continuum limit by a ${\rm CP}^1$
model with a topological term, minimally coupled to a massless Dirac field with
a four-fermion interaction. The bosonic term of this action describes the spin
waves produced by the spinons, while the fermionic term represents the low
energy charge excitations. This theory exhibits explicitly a local abelian
gauge invariance.

perturbations of different physical origins is described analytically and
numerically. The analytical approach is based on asymptotic expansions, and it
allows to derive, in a rigorous way, an effective nonlinear equation for the
slowly varying field component in any order of the asymptotic procedure as
expansions in the small parameter $\omega^{-1}$, $\omega$ being the frequency
of the rapidly varying ac driving force. Three physically important examples of
such a dynamics, {\em i.e.}, kinks driven by a direct or parametric ac force,
and kinks on rotating and oscillating background, are analysed in detail. It is
shown that in the main order of the asymptotic procedure the effective equation
for the slowly varying field component is {\em a renormalized sine-Gordon
equation} in the case of the direct driving force or rotating (but phase-locked
to an external ac force) background, and it is {\em the double sine-Gordon
equation} for the parametric driving force. The properties of the kinks
described by the renormalized nonlinear equations are analysed, and it is
demonstrated analytically and numerically which kinds of physical phenomena may
be expected in dealing with the renormalized, rather than the unrenormalized,
nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we predict several qualitatively new effects
which include, {\em e.g.}, the perturbation-induced internal oscillations of
the $2\pi-$kink in a parametrically driven sine-Gordon model, and generation of
kink motion by a pure ac driving force on a rotating background.

demonstrate both analytically and numerically that a pure {\it ac} bias current

driving frequency and the spatial period of the modulation, provided that the
drive amplitude exceeds a certain threshold value. In the range of strongly
``relativistic'' mean velocities, the agreement between results of a numerical
solution of the effective (ODE) fluxon equation of motion and analytical
results obtained by means of the harmonic-balance analysis is fairly good;
morever, a preliminary PDE result tends to confirm the validity of the
collective-coordinate (PDE-ODE) reduction. At nonrelativistic mean velocities,
the basin of attraction, in position-velocity space, for phase-locked solutions
becomes progressively smaller as the mean velocity is decreased.
