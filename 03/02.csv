illuminate the close connection between growth models and self-avoiding paths

The Generalised Factorial Moments are defined for all $q$ in the complex plane

for the study of infrared structure of the Strong Interactions Theory of high
energy interactions (LEP multiplicity distribution under the ${\cal Z}_0$). The
QCD calculation of the Generalised Factorial Moments for negative $q$ is
performed in the double leading log accuracy and is compared to OPAL
experimental data. The role played by the infrared cut-off of the model is
discussed and illustrated with a Monte Carlo calculation. }

for the supersymmetry, and consider only certain equivalence classes of fields,
then our quantum hamiltonian reduction reduces to quantum hamiltonian reduction
of non-supersymmetric Lie superalgebras. We construct explicitly the super
energy-momentum tensor, as well as all generators of spin 1 (and $\hf$); thus
we construct explicitly all generators in the superconformal,
quasi-superconformal and $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$ superconformal algebras.
