The time-dependent, three-dimensional hydrodynamic equations are solved with
minimal simplifications.
  The statistical information obtained from the present simulation provides an
improved understanding of solar photospheric convection. The characteristics of
solar convection in shallow regions is parameterized and compared with the
results of Chan and Sofia's simulations of deep and efficient convection (Chan
and Sofia 1989). We assess the importance of the zones of partial ionization in
the simulation, and confirm that the radiative energy transfer is negligible
throughout the region except in the uppermost scale heights of the convection
zone, a region of very high super-adiabaticity.
  When the effects of partial ionization are included, the dynamics of flows
are altered significantly. However, we confirm the Chan and Sofia result that
kinetic energy flux is non-negligible and can have a negative value in the

  # 94/8, submitted to Nature",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Globular clusters cores harbour many low-mass X-ray binaries, cataclysmic
variables, and millisecond pulsar binaries which are likely to have been formed
via the process of tidal capture. Tidal capture binaries were originally
thought to be responsible for halting core collapse and for subsequent
re-expansion via the process of ``binary heating''. The standard model, now
suggests that these binaries are no longer viable as a direct energy source. We
present the results of a study which suggests that tidal capture binaries may
indeed be a significant direct source of energy for the cores of globular
clusters. We show that following capture, these binaries go through a short,
violent chaotic phase, with the orbital eccentricity (and hence the tidal
energy) suffering large changes on a very short timescale. This is followed by
a long quiescent phase in which the tidal energy remains small while the orbit
circularizes only via normal dissipative effects. This quiescent phase allows
captured main sequence stars to evolve in the absence of large tides, a fact
important for the production of low-mass X-ray binaries and cataclysmic
variables.

fraction of quasars which would be undetectable in photographic surveys using
optical variability alone as the selection criterium. (5) A broad class of
flat-spectrum radio quasars are no blazars, they are even less variable in the

tables. Distance moduli and visual extinctions are determined. A comparison of
the visual extinctions to IRAS $100\um$ data shows that the near edge of the
Orion A and B clouds lies at a distance of $\sim 320\pc$, while the far edge is
at $\sim 500\pc$. A method for deriving the ages of the subgroups by comparing
theoretical isochrones to the observations in the log g, log T plane is
presented. The derived ages suggest, contrary to earlier studies, that subgroup
1b is younger than 1c, which can possibly be explained by past geometries of
the system of stars and gas. The initial mass function for Orion OB1 is derived
with the aid of the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. Through extensive simulations, we
show that it is very difficult to derive accurately the IMF from the available
data. To within somewhat weak limits the IMF is found to be of the form $\xi
(\log M)=AM^{-1.7\pm 0.2}$ for all subgroups. The energy output of the
subgroups in the form of stellar winds and supernovae is calculated and
compared to the observed size and expansion velocity of the Orion-Eridanus

temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is
quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular
velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long
before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is
positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing
outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will
tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated
accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars
and the widespread occurrence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.

component. We note the complexity of the correlation structure in DNA
sequences. The observed complexity often makes it hard, or impossible, to
decompose the sequence into a few statistically stationary regions. We suggest
that, based on the complexity of DNA sequences, a fruitful approach to
understand long-range correlation is to model duplication, and other
rearrangement processes, in DNA sequences. One model, called
``expansion-modification system"", contains only point duplication and point
mutation. Though simplistic, this model is able to generate sequences with 1/f
spectra. We emphasize the importance of DNA duplication in its contribution to
the observed long-range correlation in DNA sequences.

measurements the $\nu_e$ survival probability can be determined as a function
of neutrino energy. The general case of transitions of solar $\nu_e$'s into
active as well as sterile neutrinos is considered. A number of relations
between measurable quantities the test of which will allow to answer the
question whether there are sterile neutrinos in the solar neutrino flux on the
earth are derived. Transitions of solar $\nu_e$'s into active and sterile
states due to neutrino mixing and Dirac magnetic moments or into active
