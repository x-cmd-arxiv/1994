approach to quantum mechanics and the quantum state diffusion (QSD) picture,
for open quantum systems described by a master equation of Lindblad form. The
(physically unique) set of variables that localize in the QSD picture also
define an approximately decoherent set of histories in the DH approach. The
degree of localization is related to the degree of decoherence, and the
probabilities for histories prescribed by each approach are essentially the
same.

\gaga\ fusion at high energy pp colliders. We revise previous claims that the
\gaga\ cross section is comparable to or larger than that for the corresponding
Drell-Yan process at high energies. Indeed we find that the \gaga\ contribution
to the total production cross section at pp is far below the Drell-Yan cross
section. As far as the individual elastic, semi-elastic and inelastic
contributions to the \gaga\ process are concerned we find that they are all of
the same order of magnitude.

$q$-deformed cocycle hierarchy. Some recursive relations related to the
generalized $q$-deformed Killing forms are derived to prove the cocycle
hierarchy formulas directly. At last, we construct the $q$-gauge covariant
Lagrangian and derive the $q$-deformed Yang-Mills equation. We find that the
components of the singlet and the adjoint representation are separated in the

quantum algebra, which is generated by three fields of spin-2 and a field of
spin-1, is explicitly constructed. A `free field' realisation of the algebra in
terms of the zero-grade currents is given, and it is shown that these commute
with a screening charge. We investigate the representation theory of the
algebra using a combination of the explicit fusion method of Bauer et al. and
free field methods. We discuss the fusion rules of degenerate primary fields,
and give various character formulae and a Kac determinant formula for the
algebra
