leads to universal de Vaucouleurs profiles only outside 1.5 effective radii
$R_e$. Inside $1.5 R_e$ the surface density profiles depend strongly on the
initial conditions and are in general not in agreement with the de Vaucouleurs
law. This result is in contradiction to the observations which show that all
elliptical galaxies have de Vaucouleurs profiles inside $1.5 R_e$ and show
strong deviations outside $1.5 R_e$. The $r^{1/4}$-profiles of E-galaxies are
therefore not a direct result of collisionless violent relaxation and angular
momentum redistribution. It is rather a universal initial density profile which
is required in order to explain the universal structure of E-galaxies. A new
model for the formation of E-galaxies is presented which assumes that
ellipticals and bulges formed from isothermal, gaseous spheres which
accumulated in the core regions of dark matter halos and condensed into stars
through a cooling instability. This scenario predicts that early type galaxies
trace directly the core radii and core masses of their dark matter halos,
providing important information on the nature of the dark matter component in
galaxies.

the Abell and ACO catalogs of rich galaxy clusters. We also discuss different
technical aspects of the method when applied to data sets with small number of
points as the cluster catalogs. Results are compared with simulations based on
the Zel'dovich approximation. We limit our analysis to scales less than 100
$\hm$. The cluster distribution show a scale invariant multifractal behavior in
a limited scale range. For the Abell catalog this range is 15--60$\hm$, while
for the ACO sample it extends to smaller scales. Despite this difference in the
extension of the scale--range where scale--invariant clustering takes place,
both samples are characterized by remarkably similar multifractal spectra in
the corresponding scaling regime. In particular, the correlation dimension
turns out to be $D_2\simeq 2.2$ for both Abell and ACO clusters. Although it is
difficult to point out the scale at which homogeneity is reached with the
present size of these redshift surveys, our results indicate that the cluster
distribution shows a tendency to homogeneity at large scales, disproving the
picture of a pure scale invariant fractal structure extending to arbitrarily
large distances.
