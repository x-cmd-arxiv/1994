the vector space T^1 of infinitesimal deformations is related to the
complexified vector spaces of rational Minkowski summands of faces of Q.
Moreover, assuming Y to be an isolated, at least 3-dimensional singularity, Y
will be rigid unless it is even Gorenstein and dim Y=3 (dim Q=2). For this
particular case, so-called toric deformations of Y correspond to Minkowski
decompositions of Q into a sum of lattice polygons. Their Kodaira-Spencer-map
can be interpreted in a very natural way. We regard the projective variety P(Y)
defined by the lattice polygon Q. Data concerning the deformation theory of Y
can be interpreted as data concerning the Picard group of P(Y). Finally, we
provide some examples (the cones over the toric Del Pezzo surrfaces). There is
one such variety yielding Spec C[e]/e^2 as the base space of the semi-universal
deformation.
