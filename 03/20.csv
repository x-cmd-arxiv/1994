operators, in superstring derived standard--like models. I classify the sectors
that produce color triplet superfields which may generate proton decay from
dimension five and six operators. I show that for two of these sectors there
exist a unique superstring doublet--triplet splitting mechanism that projects
out the color triplets by means of the GSO projection, while leaving the
electroweak doublets in the physical spectrum. I investigate possible proton
decay due to additional color triplets in the massless spectrum and due to
nonrenormalizable terms. I show that there exist models in which the dimension
four, five and six operators, that lead to proton decay, are forbidden by the
symmetries of the string models, to all orders of nonrenormalizable terms.

analyzed. In the action considered, the metric in the world sheet of the string
is the induced metric, and the theory presents second order time derivatives.
The canonical formalism is developed and it is showed that first and second
class constraints appear. The degrees of freedoom are the same than for the
free bosonic string. The light cone gauge is used to reduce to the physical
modes and to compute the physical hamiltonian.

reminiscent of the Coste-L\""uscher results for the parity anomaly in (2+1)
fermionic effective actions.

of Chern-Simons theory is studied in a very general regularization scheme. We
show that the effective coupling constant $k$ induced by radiative corrections
depends crucially on the balance between the ultraviolet behavior of scalar and
pseudoscalar terms in the regularized action. There are three different
regimes. When the ultraviolet leading term is scalar the coupling $k$ is
shifted to $k+h^{\vee}$.However, if the leading term is pseudoscalar the shift
is $k+s h^{\vee}$ with $s=0$ or $s=2$ depending on the sign of such a term. In
the borderline case when the scalar and pseudoscalar terms have the same
ultraviolet behavior the shift of $k$ becomes arbitrary (even non-integer) and
depends on the parameters of the regularization. We also show that the
coefficient of the induced gravitational Chern-Simons term is different for the
three regimes and has the same universality properties than the effective
coupling constant $k$. The results open the possibility of a connection with
non-rational two-dimensional conformal theories in the borderline regime.
