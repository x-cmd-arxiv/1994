galaxies. We find that the redshift space two-point correlation function is
well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.11+\-0.09, with clustering length
3.87+\-0.32 Mpc/h out to pair separations of 25 Mpc\h. On scales larger than 40
Mpc/h, the correlation function is consistent with zero. The r.m.s. fluctuation
in the count of QDOT galaxies above the Poisson level in spheres of radius 8
Mpc/h is \sigma_8^{IRAS}=0.58+\-0.14, showing that fluctuations in the
distribution of IRAS galaxies on these scales are smaller than those of optical
galaxies by a factor of about 0.65, with an uncertainty of 25%. We find no
detectable difference between the correlation functions measured in redshift
space and in real space, leading to a $2\sigma$ limit of b_{IRAS}/\Omega^{0.6}
>1.05, where b_{IRAS} is the bias factor for IRAS galaxies and \Omega is the
cosmological density parameter. The QDOT autocorrelation function calculated in
concentric shells increases significantly with shell radius. This difference is
more likely due to sampling fluctuations than to an increase of the clustering
strength with galaxy luminosity, but the two effects are difficult to
disentangle; our data allow at most an increase of \sim 20% in clustering
strength for each decade in luminosity. For separations greater than \sim 3
Mpc/h, the cross-correlation function of Abell clusters (with Richness R\ge 1)
and QDOT galaxies is well approximated by a power-law of slope -1.81+\-0.10,
with clustering length 10.10+\-0.45 Mpc/h, and no significant signal beyond
\gsim 50 Mpc\h. This cross-correlation depends only weakly on cluster richness.

and being coupled by ballistic point contacts to two electron reservoirs) is
computed on the single assumption that its scattering matrix is a member of
Dyson's circular ensemble. General formulas are obtained for the mean and
variance of transport properties in the orthogonal (beta=1), unitary (beta=2),
and symplectic (beta=4) symmetry class. Applications include universal
conductance fluctuations, weak localization, sub-Poissonian shot noise, and
normal-metal-superconductor junctions. The complete distribution P(g) of the
conductance g is computed for the case that the coupling to the reservoirs
occurs via two quantum point contacts with a single transmitted channel. The
result P(g)=g^(-1+beta/2) is qualitatively different in the three symmetry
classes. ***Submitted to Europhysics Letters.****

connected, but neither Hausdorff nor a manifold. However, removing from ${\cal

as the cotangent bundle over a non-Hausdorff base space. Avenues towards
quantizing the theory are discussed in view of the relation between spacetime
metrics and the various parts of~${\cal M}$. (Contribution to the proceedings

sufficiently accurate to see the non-oblique corrections from the heavy gauge
boson responsible for the large top mass in standard extended tecnicolour
models. If the ETC couplings are strong the techni-fermion condensate may be
enhanced by several orders of magnitude allowing a top mass of order 150GeV to
be obtained for large values of the ETC breaking scale sufficient to supress
the ETC contribution to the $Zb{\bar b}$ vertex. In this letter we investigate
the degree of fine tuning of the ETC coupling required in a realistic model. We
conclude that the fine tuning need only be of order $10\%$.

function of the nucleon resonance $N^*(1535)$ in the quark-diquark picture.
Using this wave function and the extended hard scattering picture, the
$N$--$N^*$ transition form factors are calculated at large momentum transfer
and the results compared to experimental data. As a further application of our
method we briefly discuss the $\pi$--$a_1$ form factors in an appendix.
