extended towards a more detailed investigation of the spin parameter

homogeneous ellipsoid with the inertial tensor of the (highly irregular)
Lagrangian region $\Upsilon$ from which the dark halo forms. Within this
approximation, an expression for the spin parameter can be derived, which
depends on the geometry of $\Upsilon$, the cosmological density parameter
$\Omega_0$, the overdensity of the dark halo, and the tidal torque exerted on
it. For Gaussian random fields, this expression can be evaluated statistically.
As a result, we derive a probability distribution of the spin parameter which
gives $\lambda\simeq0.07^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, consistent with numerical
investigations. This probability distribution steeply rises with increasing
spin parameter, reaching its maximum at $\lambda\simeq0.025$. The 10 (50,90)

the half-mass radius after core collapse nearly follows classical theory, The
evolution of the inner parts of the system around the time of core bounce is
consistent with these simplified models provided that the continuous production
of energy, as usually assumed, is replaced by a model of {\sl stochastic}

modest recalibration of the coefficient of energy generation, especially for
small $N$. The distributions of velocity dispersion and anisotropy become
remarkably homologous soon after core bounce. The bound mass of the systems
very nearly follows a power law with time. A small number of escapers, presumed
to be those associated with binary activity, dominate the energy which is

slowing down usually encountered as the bare quark mass is tuned to the chiral

suggest a conjecture that the continuum limit of XQCD is the same as the
continuum limit of conventional lattice formulation of QCD. As examples of such
universality, we present the large N solutions of two prototype models for
XQCD, in which the mass of the spurious pion and sigma resonance go to infinity

this idea, a lattice simulation suggests itself. In view of the difficulty of
such a calculation we have, as a first step, investigated the problem in the
$CP^3$ model. The $CP^3$ model is in many respects similar to QCD. In this talk
I shall present some first results of our calculation. Among other things it is
shown that the model has a first order deconfining phase transition in $\theta$
and that the critical value of $\theta$ decreases towards zero as $\beta$ is
taken to infinity. This suggests that $\theta$ is tuned to zero in the
continuum limit.

scheme are partially ordered sets (posets). Now, in ordinary quantum physics on
a manifold $M$, continuous probability densities generate the commutative

physical significance, containing the information to reconstruct the topology
