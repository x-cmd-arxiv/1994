oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for
convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these
oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must
be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements,
even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude.
  This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude
of oscillations (dL/L) can be derived from the velocity amplitude v_osc. Using
linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a
large sample of pulsating stars satisfy
  (dL/L)_bol proportional to v_osc/T_eff. Using this relationship, together
with the best estimate of v_osc(Sun) = (23.4 +/- 1.4) cm/s, we estimate the
luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550 nm to be dL/L = (4.7 +/- 0.3)
ppm.
  Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e.,
convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only
predictions come from model calculations by (Christensen-Dalsgaard & Frandsen,
Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough
to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although
convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties
of convection -- including oscillation amplitudes -- should change smoothly
through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity

study of the algebra of additional symmetries of this new hierarchy reveals
that it is isomorphic to the super-W_{1+\infty} algebra, thus making it a
candidate for a possible interrelationship between superintegrability and
two-dimensional supergravity.

involutions, having their origin in the theory of exactly solvable
vertex-models in lattice statistical mechanics. These involutions correspond
respectively to two kinds of transformations on $q \times q$ matrices: the
inversion of the $q \times q$ matrix and an (involutive) permutation of the
entries of the matrix. We concentrate on the case where these permutations are
elementary transpositions of two entries. In this case the birational
transformations fall into six different classes. For each class we analyze the
factorization properties of the iteration of these transformations. These
factorization properties enable to define some canonical homogeneous
polynomials associated with these factorization properties. Some mappings yield
a polynomial growth of the complexity of the iterations. For three classes the
successive iterates, for $q=4$, actually lie on elliptic curves. This analysis
also provides examples of integrable mappings in arbitrary dimension, even
infinite. Moreover, for two classes, the homogeneous polynomials are shown to
satisfy non trivial non-linear recurrences. The relations between
factorizations of the iterations, the existence of recurrences on one or
several variables, as well as the integrability of the mappings are analyzed.

invariance of the $\beta$-function equations of string theory on
$d+1$-dimensional targets with $d$ toroidal isometries. It corresponds to a
shift of the dilaton field and a scaling of the lapse function, and is
reminiscent of string field redefinitions. While it preserves the form of the
$\beta$-function equations, it changes the effective action and the solutions.
Thus it can be used as a solution generating technique. It is particularly
interesting to note that there are field redefinitions which map solutions with
non-zero string cosmological constant to those with zero cosmological constant.
Several simple examples involving two- and three-dimensional black holes and
black strings are provided to illustrate the role of such field redefinitions.

orbits. The $1/N$ perturbation theory around a classical solution that
corresponds to the filled Dirac sea leads to the 'tHooft equation for meson
