  from azijlstr@eso.org. ESO-AZ-02",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Radio continuum emission has been detected from a planetary nebula in the
Large Magellanic Cloud: this is the first radio continuum detection for any
planetary nebula outside our galaxy. The radio flux density is a factor of two
lower than predicted from the \hbeta\ flux. This could be due either to a
two-component morphology or to a stellar contribution to the \hbeta\ emission.
We have modeled the optical and infrared spectrum using the photo-ionisation
code Cloudy: a very good fit is obtained if we assume the nebula is carbon
rich. The derived diameter implies an evolutionary age of the nebula of
$<1000\yr$, similar to what is derived from the IRAS colours alone. The central
star, which is of [WC] type, has a much higher stellar temperature than
Galactic [WC] stars showing similar circumstellar IRAS colours. An explanation
could be that the expansion velocity of the nebula is lower than those of its
galactic counterparts. This radio detection indicates that accurate nebular
luminosities could be determined from their radio emission for many LMC
planetary nebulae.

the nucleon in the threshold region. To calculate the pertinent amplitudes, we
make use of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We show that due to finite
chiral loops the production cross section for final states with two neutral
pions is considerably enhanced. The experimental implications are briefly
discussed.
