estimate the ability of our models to fit the observations, as measured by the

this analysis we conclude that the best model is the unbiased standard model
$(n,~b)=(1,~1)$, even though the overall flatness of the joint likelihood
function implies that one cannot strongly discriminate models in the range $0.8
\le n \le 1$, and $1 \le b \le 1.5$. Models with $b \geq 2.5$ are rejected at
the $95\%$ confidence level. For $n=0.8$ the values of $b$ preferred by the
present analysis, together with the {\em COBE} data, require a negligible
contribution to $\Delta T/T$ by gravitational waves. Finally, the blue model,
normalized to {\em COBE}, does not provide a good fit to the velocity data.

magnetically and electrically charged extremal 4D black hole solutions of
heterotic string theory are presented. They are constructed using a $(0,1)$
supersymmetric $SL(2,R)\times SU(2)$ WZW model where anomalously embedded
$U(1)\times U(1)$ subgroups are gauged. Crucial cancelations of the $U(1)$
anomalies coming from the supersymmetric fermions, the current algebra fermions
and the gauging ensure that there is a consistency of these models at the
quantum level. Various 2D models, which may be considered as building blocks
for extremal 4D constructions, are presented. They generalise the class of 2D
models which might be obtained from gauging $SL(2,R)$ and coincide with known
heterotic string backgrounds. The exact conformal field theory presented by
Giddings, Polchinski and Strominger describing the angular sector of the
extremal magnetically charged black hole is a special case of this
construction. An example where the radial and angular theories are mixed
non--trivially is studied in detail, resulting in an extremal dilatonic
Taub--NUT--like dyon.

formula for the product of two spherical elements for a quantum Gelfand pair of
two compact quantum groups. A similar construction is discussed for the case of
a generalized quantum Gelfand pair, where the role of the quantum subgroup is
taken over by a two-sided coideal in the dual Hopf algebra. The paper starts
with a review of compact quantum groups, with an approach in terms of so-called
CQG algebras. The paper concludes with some examples of hypergroups thus
obtained.
