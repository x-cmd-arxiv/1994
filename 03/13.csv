equations of the gravitational instability in an expanding universe. In this
approach pancaking is the predominant form of first collapsing objects.
Relativistic counterparts of these equations contain the electric and magnetic
parts of the Weyl tensor. In the linear theory the magnetic part is associated
with gravitational waves. If the magnetic part is ignored, then the newtonian
limit of the relativistic equations is reduced to the closed set of the local
Lagrangian equations. Recently this fact drew much attention since the
gravitational instability in that form would greatly simplify the study of
cosmic structure formation. In particular, the filamentary structure of
collapsing is predicted. In this paper we resolve the contradiction between the
newtonian theory and relativistic version adopted in some recent papers. We
show that dropping the magnetic part from the basic relativistic equations is
{\it incorrect}. The correct newtonian limit is derived by the $1/c$-expansion
of the GR equations and the Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor. The last
ones begin with $\sim 1/c^3$ order, therefore one {\it must} take into account
the magnetic part in the post newtonian order $\sim 1/c^3$, which contains
non-local terms, related to the non-local gravitational interaction. For the
first time we rigorously show that the GR equations with the magnetic part are
reduced precisely to the canonic newtonian non-local equations. Thus, the
correct treatment of the relativistic version of the gravitational instability
resurrects the canonic picture of the structure formation.

thermal radiation and the problem of black hole evaporation in 3-D are studied.
In 3-D Einstein-anti-de Sitter gravity we have two relevant mass scales,
$m_c=1/G$, and $m_p=(\hbar^2\Lambda/G)^{1/3}$, which are particularly relevant
for the evaporation problem. It is argued that in the `weak coupling' regime
$\Lambda<(\hbar G)^{-2}$, the end point of an evaporating black hole formed
with an initial mass $m_0>m_p$, is likely to be a stable remnant in equilibrium
with thermal radiation. The relevance of these results for the information
problem and for the issue of back reaction is discussed. In the `strong
coupling' regime, $\Lambda>(\hbar G)^{-2}$ a full fledged quantum gravity
treatment is required. Since the total energy of thermal states in anti-de
Sitter space with reflective boundary conditions at spatial infinity is bounded
and conserved, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are well defined. For
a given temperature or energy black hole states are locally stable. In the weak
coupling regime black hole states are more probable then pure radiation states.

investigate how the results depend on their flavor structure (quark contents).
Our calculations give similar values of $M_2^s$ for these two mesons, because
of cancellation among several non-small factors. We emphasize that decay
constants, meson masses and quark masses play an essential role in the above
cancellation.

scattering at HERA: splitting the pomeron into two jets in the photon-pomeron
fusion reaction $\gamma^{*}\Pom \rightarrow q\bar{q}$. It gives rise to the
diffraction dissociation of virtual photons into the back-to-back jets. We find
that at large invariant mass $M$ of two jets, $M^{2}\gg Q^{2}$, the transverse
momentum of jets comes from the intrinsic transverse momentum of gluons in the
pomeron, and the photon-pomeron fusion direcly probes the diffrential gluon
structure function of the proton $\partial G(x,q^{2})/\partial \log q^{2}$ at
the virtuality $q^{2}\sim k^{2}$. We present estimates for the jet production
cross section, which show the process is easily measurable at HERA.
