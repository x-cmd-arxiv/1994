models including realistic thermal histories, \ie, late or partial reionization
of the universe and compact object formation after standard recombination.
Constraints on these models are imposed from spectral distortion in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), number fluctuations in galaxy counts $\sigma_8$,
and recent CMB anisotropy observations. Since the status of degree scale
anisotropies is as yet unclear, the lack of spectral distortions is the most
serious constraint on the spectral index of initial fluctuations: $-1.2 \simlt
n \simlt -0.5$ in partially ionized models and $-1.2 \simlt n \simlt -0.9$ in
compact object dominated universes in order to avoid significant bias in galaxy
formation. Full ionization of the universe before $z = 300$ is also forbidden
by this constraint. Intermediate scale CMB fluctuations which are significantly
larger than standard CDM is a {\it robust} prediction of these models. Many
models are consequently in conflict with the recent degree scale detections by
Python, ARGO, and MSAM, \eg, compact object dominated models with $\Omega_0
\simlt 0.2$. Moreover, {\it all} models will be ruled out if the low CMB
fluctuations on degree scales as detected by the SP91 13 point scan are
confirmed. On the other hand, most models fare well compared with the high
Tenerife and MAX detections.

liquid water is carried out in two ways. In the first, the water molecule is
placed in a cavity and the solvent is treated as a dielectric continuum. This
model is analyzed by numerically solving the Poisson equation using the DelPhi
program. The resulting solvation properties depend sensitively on the shape and
size of the cavity. In the second method, the solvent and solute molecules are
treated explicitly in molecular dynamics simulations using Ewald boundary
conditions. We find a 2 kcal/mole difference in solvation free energies
predicted by these two methods when standard cavity radii are used. In
addition, dielectric continuum theory assumes that the solvent reacts solely by
realigning its electric moments linearly with the strength of the solute's
electric field; the results of the molecular simulation show important
non-linear effects. Non-linear solvent effects are generally of two types:
dielectric saturation, due to solvent-solute hydrogen bonds, and
electrostriction, a decrease in the solute cavity due to an increased
electrostatic interaction. We find very good agreement between the two methods
if the radii defining the solute cavity used in the continuum theory is
decreased with the solute charges,

eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the
existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially
strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas
as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically
chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture
predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for
the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave
functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely
antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this
phenomenon {\it eigenstate thermalization}. We show that a generic initial
state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as
$O(\hbar/\Delta)t^{-1}$, where $\Delta$ is the uncertainty in the total energy
of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to
the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is
needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum
statistical mechanics.

class of inner products including the discrete Sobolev inner products $\langle
h,g \rangle = \int hg\, d\mu + \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=0}^{N_j} M_{j,i}
h^{(i)}(c_j) g^{(i)}(c_j)$, where $\mu$ is a certain type of complex measure on
the real line, and $c_j$ are complex numbers in the complement of $\supp(\mu)$.
The Sobolev orthogonal polynomials are compared with the orthogonal polynomials
corresponding to the measure $\mu$.

Hausdorff or even T_0). We prove that if T has a base of cardinality <= mu,
lambda <= mu < 2^lambda, lambda strong limit of cofinality aleph_0, then T has
cardinality <= mu or >= 2^lambda. This is our main conclusion. First we prove
it under some set theoretic assumption, which is clear when lambda = mu ; then
we eliminate the assumption by a theorem on pcf from [Sh 460] motivated
originally by this. Next we prove that the simplest examples are the basic
ones; they occur in every example (for lambda = aleph_0 this fulfill a promise
from [Sh 454]). The main result for the case lambda = aleph_0 was proved in [Sh
454].
