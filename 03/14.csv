pencil beam constructions in a high-resolution simulation of the large-scale
structure of galaxies. As an example we present the results for the case of
``Hot-Dark-Matter"" (HDM) initial conditions (with scale-free $n = 1$ power
index on large scales and $\Omega = 1$) as a representative of models with
sufficient large-scale power. We use an analytic approximation for particle
trajectories of a self-gravitating dust continuum and apply a local dynamical
biasing of volume elements to identify luminous matter in the model. Using this
method, we are able to resolve formally a simulation box of 1200h^-1 Mpc (e.g.
for HDM initial conditions) down to the scale of galactic halos using $2160^3$
particles. Pencil beam probes are taken for a given epoch using the parameters
of observed beams. In particular, our analysis concentrates on the detection of
a quasi-periodicity in the beam probes. The simulation is designed for
application to parameter studies which prepare future observational projects.
We find that a large percentage of the beams shows quasi-periodicities with
periods which cluster at a certain length scale. The periods found range
between one and eight times the cutoff length in the initial fluctuation
spectrum.

condense at $T_c$) is illustrated with the onset of a double-well structure in

confining plane is studied by a path integral method. We map this 3-d problem
on to a 1-d one, and find that the tunneling is strongly affected by the field.
Without a perpendicular field the tunneling at zero temperature can be
completely suppressed by a large parallel field, but in the small parallel
field and low temperature limit the tunneling rate is finite. An explicit
formula is obtained in this case. A quantitative explanation without fitting
parameter to a recent experiment is provided.

current is enhanced by a factor two with respect to its normal-state value, due
to Cooper-pair transport in the superconductor. For a disordered normal region,
it is still smaller than the Poisson noise, as a consequence of noiseless open
scattering channels.

this paper we introduce different basis which, as shown here, has the same
dimension as that of an RSOS-model. Following McCoy et al, we call this basis
-- fermionic (FB). Our first theorem Dim(FB)=Dim(RSOS-basis) can be succinctly
expressed in terms of some identities for binomial coefficients. Remarkably,
these binomial identities can be q-deformed. Here, we give a simple proof of
these q-binomial identities in the spirit of Schur's proof of the
Rogers-Ramanujan identities. Notably, the proof involves only the elementary
recurrences for the q-binomial coefficients and a few creative observations.
Finally, taking the limit L --> \infty in these q-identities, we derive an
expression for the character formulas of the unitary minimal series

Rocha-Caridi representation (\chi_{r,s=1}^{\nu,\nu+1}(q)) and Fermionic Sum
