including the dominant post-Newtonian effects, that employs individual
timesteps for each planet. The algorithm is symplectic and exhibits short-term
errors that are $O(\epsilon\Omega^2\tau^2)$ where $\tau$ is the timestep,
$\Omega$ is a typical orbital frequency, and $\epsilon\ll1$ is a typical
planetary mass in solar units. By a special starting procedure long-term errors
over an integration interval $T$ can be reduced to
$O(\epsilon^2\Omega^3\tau^2T)$. A sample 0.8 Myr integration of the nine
planets illustrates that Pluto can have a timestep more than 100 times
Mercury's, without dominating the positional error. Our algorithm is applicable
to other $N$-body systems.

Assuming that the gravitino mainly decays into a photon and a photino, we
calculate the upperbound on the reheating temperature. Compared to previous
works, we have essentially improved the following two points: (i) the helicity
$\pm\frac{3}{2}$ gravitino production cross sections are calculated by using
the full relevant terms in the supergravity lagrangian, and (ii) the high
energy photon spectrum is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations
numerically. Photo-dissociation of the light elements (D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He)
leads to the most stringent upperbound on the reheating temperature, which is
given by ($10^{6}$--$10^{9}$)GeV for the gravitino mass 100GeV--1TeV. On the
other hand, requiring that the present mass density of photino should be
smaller than the critical density, we find that the reheating temperature have
to be smaller than ($10^{11}$--$10^{12}$)GeV for the photino mass (10--100)GeV,
irrespectively of the gravitino mass. The effect of other decay channels is
also considered.
