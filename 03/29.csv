Assuming that gravitino mainly decays into photon and photino, we have
calculated the upperbound of the reheating temperature. Compared to previous
works, we have essentially improved the following two points; (i) the helicity
$\pm\frac{3}{2}$ gravitino production cross sections are calculated by using
the full relevant terms in the supergravity lagrangian, and (ii) high energy
photon spectrum is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations numerically.
Photo-dissociation of the light elements (D, T, $^3$He, $^4$He) leads to the
most stringent upperbound of the reheating temperature, which is given by
($10^{6}$--$10^{9}$)GeV for the gravitino mass 100GeV--1TeV. On the other hand,
requiring that the present mass density of photino should be smaller than the
critical density, we find that the reheating temperature have to be smaller
than ($10^{11}$--$10^{12}$)GeV for the photino mass (10--100)GeV,
irrespectively of the gravitino mass. The effect of other decay channel is also
considered.

morphologically classified each galaxy (early--type, late--type, merged or
uncertain), they have estimated the parameters of a Schechter luminosity
function for early-- and late--type galaxies. However, in their sample there is
a bias against identifying early--type galaxies at large distances and/or faint
magnitudes: in fact, many of the early--type galaxies at faint magnitudes have
probably been classified as ``uncertain"". As discussed in Loveday et al., the
existence of such a bias is indicated by the fact that for these galaxies
$<V/V_{max}>=0.32$. In this paper we show, both theoretically and through the
use of simulated samples, that this incompleteness strongly biases the derived
parameters of the luminosity function for early--type galaxies. If no
correction for such incompleteness is applied to the data (as done by Loveday
et al.), one obtains a flatter slope $\alpha$ and a brighter $M^*$ with respect
to the real parameters.

$\delta R_{\tau/\pi} = \left(0.16_{\T - 0.14}^{\T+0.09}\right) \%$. For the
ratio $\Gamma(\tau\to K\nu_\tau(\gamma)) / \Gamma(K\to \mu\nu_\mu(\gamma))$, we
obtain $\delta R_{\tau/K } = \left(0.90_{\T - 0.26}^{\T + 0.17}\right) \%$. For

corrections, higher-order perturbative QCD corrections and non- perturbative
contributions are discussed. Recent measurements of charmonium annihilation
rates are used to evaluate the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$
simultaneously with the wave functions (and their derivatives) at the origin.
Further predictions are made for yet unobserved decay rates. The various models
for quarkonium production in hadronic collisions are critically reviewed. Based
on the charmonium model, the cross sections of different quarkonium states are
given in a well-defined QCD perturbation series, including quark--antiquark,
quark--gluon, and gluon--gluon scatterings. Numerical estimates are given for
charmonium production in $\p\p$, $\ppbar$, and $\pi\p$ collisions. The role of
indirect $\JP$ production via $\chi_{\c J}(1P)$, $\eta_{\c}(2S)$, $\psi(2S)$
and $\b$-decays is pointed out. Relativistic effects and non-perturbative
contributions are found to be important. Existing measurements are compiled and
shown to be well explained if all contributions are included. The ${}^1S_0$
cross section is calculated in complete next-to-leading order. Finally, a study
of the high-energy behaviour of quarkonium cross sections is made, based on the
asymptotical behaviour of higher-order QCD corrections.

improved effective potential we find $m_H^c\sim$ 70 GeV. The scalar
self-coupling has a Landau-type singularity also in the abelian U(1)-Higgs

introduced and investigated in detail. Some properties of this class, as
duality and complementation, are analogous to properties of classical $l_p$
spaces, although the latter is more ``regular'' than its classical counterpart;
in contrast, the property exhibited in the uniqueness theorem is very different
than for spaces $l_p$.

above question and give in particular a negative answer in case of approximable
operators.
