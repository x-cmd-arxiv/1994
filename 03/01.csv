new decomposition is more likely to be compatible with the canonical
decomposition of the intersection products and each term in the decomposition
thus has simple geometric meaning. Our study is motivated by its applications
to some geometric problems. In particular, we use the decomposition to find the
distribution of limiting linear subspaces in degenerations of hypersurfaces. A
family of identities for characteristic classes of vector bundles is also
obtained as another consequence. This paper will appear in Duke Math. Jour.

  relativistic periodic Toda chains","7 pages (LATEX)",,"10.1016/0375-9601(94)90369-7",,"hep-th",,"  A new integrable class of quantum models representing a family of different
discrete-time or relativistic generalisations of the periodic Toda chain (TC),
including that of a recently proposed classical close to TC model [7] is
presented. All such models are shown to be obtainable from a single ancestor
model at different realisations of the underlying quantised algebra. As a
consequence the $(2\times 2)$ Lax operators and the associated quantum
$R$-matrices for these models are easily derived ensuring their quantum
integrability.
  It is shown that the functional Bethe ansatz developed for the quntum TC is
trivially generalised to achieve seperation of variables also for the present
models.

pre-equilibrium exciton model is used to calculate the $\gamma$ emission from a
decay of $^{160}$Er$^{*}$ created in two different ways. The initial stage of a

reproduce the main features of the observed $\gamma$ energy spectra including
the fact that the spectrum observed in more symmetric combination is slightly
harder than in the other case.
