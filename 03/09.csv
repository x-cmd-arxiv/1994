  PACS:{05.45.+b,92.60.Wc}, email:[mbk,hdia,sid]@inls1.ucsd.edu",,,,"chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  It is frequently asserted that in a chaotic system two initially close points
will separate at an exponential rate governed by the largest global Lyapunov
exponent. Local Lyapunov exponents, however, are more directly relevant to
predictability. The difference between the local and global Lyapunov exponents,
the large variations of local exponents over an attractor, and the saturation
of error growth near the size of the attractor---all result in non-exponential
scalings in errors at both short and long prediction times, sometimes even
obscuring evidence of exponential growth. Failure to observe exponential error
scaling cannot rule out deterministic chaos as an explanation. We demonstrate a
simple model that quantitatively predicts observed error scaling from the local
Lyapunov exponents, for both short and surprisingly long times. We comment on
the relevance to atmospheric predictability as studied in the meteorological
literature.

and its nonabelian extension. The first class constraints and the involutive
Hamiltonian are explicitly constructed. The connection of our Hamiltonian
approach with the usual Lagrangian formalism is elucidated. For the Proca model

generalized for cluster decay. It is shown that for the decay of even-even
parents, $logT_{1/2}$ depends linearly on the scaling variable
S=(Z$_{c}$Z$_{d})^{0.6}/\sqrt{Q_{c}}$ and on the square root of the reduced
mass of cluster and daughter.

relativistic, electromagnetic gauge-invariant treatment. Gluon dressing of the
quark-photon vertex and the quark self-energy functions is described by the
inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation and the
Schwinger-Dyson equation in the rainbow approximation respectively. Results for
the calculation of the quark-photon vertex are presented in both the time-like
and space-like regions of photon momentum squared, however emphasis is placed
on the space-like region relevant to electron scattering. The treatment
presented here simultaneously addresses the role of dynamically generated
$q\bar{q}$ vector bound states and the approach to asymptotic behavior. The
resulting description is therefore applicable over the entire range of momentum
transfers available in electron scattering experiments. Input parameters are
limited to the model gluon two-point function, which is chosen to reflect
confinement and asymptotic freedom, and are largely constrained by the obtained
bound-state spectrum.

dimensional nonlinear diffusion equation $u_t = u_{xx} + f(u)$. It has been
rigorously shown by Aronson and Weinberger that for a wide class of functions
$f$, sufficiently localized initial conditions evolve in time into a monotonic
front which propagates with speed $c^*$ such that $2 \sqrt{f'(0)} \leq c^* < 2
\sqrt{\sup(f(u)/u)}$. The lower value $c_L = 2 \sqrt{f'(0)}$ is that predicted
by the linear marginal stability speed selection mechanism. We derive a new
lower bound on the the speed of the selected front, this bound depends on $f$
and thus enables us to assess the extent to which the linear marginal selection
mechanism is valid.
