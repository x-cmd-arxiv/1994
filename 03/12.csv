  WJH_proc94#1",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Doppler shifts of optical emission lines which have been scattered by
surrounding dust and electrons can provide useful information about the
kinematics, geometry and physical conditions of astrophysical flows. In
principle, the scatterers can provide views of the line-emitting gas from
different directions, allowing the 3-d velocity field of the emitting gas to be
determined and revealing sources which are hidden from direct view.
Unfortunately, as in a Hall of Mirrors, the resultant multiple images can be
confusing and hard to interpret. In general, the scattering geometry will be
unknown, which makes it difficult to disentangle the effect of the motion of
the scatterers from that of the motion of the emitting source. In this
situation, spectropolarimetric observations can be a great help, since the
scattered light will be partially polarised to a degree dependent on the angle
of scattering and on the details of the scattering process. Analysis of the
polarisation profiles of the scattered emission lines can then determine the
relative orientation and velocity of the source and the scatterers. Such
techniques are applied to the upstream scattered emission lines in the HH 1
jet, where it is shown that spectropolarimetric measurements would allow an
independent determination of the bowshock velocity with respect to the upstream
matter, which would test ``multiple outburst'' models of the jet.

continuous density field are studied. We present further developments and
compare dynamically motivated methods to derive the PDF. One of them is based
on the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). We extend this method for arbitrary
initial conditions, regardless of whether they are Gaussian or not. The other
approach is based on perturbation theory with Gaussian initial fluctuations. We
include the smoothing effects in the PDFs. We examine the relationships between
the shapes of the PDFs and the moments. It is found that formally there are no
moments in the ZA, but a way to resolve this issue is proposed, based on the
regularization of integrals. A closed form for the generating function of the
moments in the ZA is also presented, including the smoothing effects. We
suggest the methods to build PDFs out of the whole series of the moments, or
out of a limited number of moments -- the Edgeworth expansion. The last
approach gives us an alternative method to evaluate the skewness and kurtosis
by measuring the PDF around its peak. We note a general connection between the
generating function of moments for small r.m.s $\sigma$ and the non-linear
evolution of the overdense spherical fluctuation in the dynamical models. All
these approaches have been applied in 1D case where the ZA is exact, and simple
analytical results are obtained. The 3D case is analyzed in the same manner and
we found a mutual agreement in the PDFs derived by different methods in the the
quasi-linear regime. Numerical CDM simulation was used to validate the accuracy
of considered approximations. We explain the successful log-normal fit of the
PDF from that simulation at moderate $\sigma$ as mere fortune, but not as a
universal form of density PDF in general.
